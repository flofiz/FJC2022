Semblat;Amelie;Drought stress impacts the microbiota mediating iron dynamic in the pea rhizosphere;Poster;Microbiota, with their consortia of genomes, extend the genetic pool of host plants to form ?extended genotypes?, resulting in extended host phenotypes. Recently, the term ?holobiont?, which encompasses the host plant plus its associated microbiota, has been proposed. The way environmental properties impact both the plant and microbial components of the holobiont and its phenotype still remain to be explored.That?s why our study aims to test the impact of different abiotic conditions (drought stress and soil pH) on plant and microbial phenotypes in relation with iron. Iron bioavailability is essential to plant and microbial physiology, and depends on soil aeration and pH.Two pea cultivars, showing different tolerance to iron chlorosis, were cultivated in two soils with different pH and textures. Aeration of these soils was modified by submitting them to three different matric potentials (saturated water SW, field capacity FC and wilting point WP). Pea phenotypes were characterized by measuring their biomass and ionomic content. Microbial phenotypes were characterized by assessing their ability to synthesize siderophores and their susceptibility to iron stress.Plant biomass and iron content were lower in both soils when they were submitted to drought stress (WP), likely to increase soil aeration and thus iron oxidation leading to low bioavailability. Accordingly, the occurrence of bacterial isolates producing siderophores was higher in these iron stress conditions. This bioavailability is known to be even more decreased in soils with higher pH, and isolates were indeed further less susceptible to iron deficiency.In conclusion, microbial populations producing siderophores were more represented in drought conditions, corresponding to higher aeration, whatever the soil was. This suggests that drought stress has a similar impact on both the plant and microbial phenotypes independently from soil type.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Agro�cologie;Agroecology;;
Zhu;Liya;Different Medicago truncatula genotypes, expressing different phenotypes, modulate microbial functional genes in the rhizosphere;Poster;Plants host in their rhizosphere a remarkable diversity of microorganisms that in return promote plant growth and health. Thus, the plant microbiota emerges as a novel component that expand the capacity of plants to adapt to the environment, and thus pave the way for future breeding approaches.It is widely known that different plant species harbor different microbiota, but very few studies showed an impact of the plant genotypes on the microbiota. These contrasting results may depend on the choice of the tested genotypes.We formulate the hypothesis that only those plant genotypes showing high genetic diversity and expressing different phenotypes harbor different rhizosphere microbiota and are able to modulate the microbial functioning. In this study, we aimed to assess a possible relation between the genetic/phenotypic diversity within Medicago truncatula and their associated microbiota.Seven M. truncatula genotypes were chosen on the basis of their geographical origin, genetic and phenotypic (notably their different nutritional strategies) diversity. Plant biomass and the carbon and nitrogen content in shoot and root were measured in order to describe their phenotypes. Microbial taxonomic diversity and functional genes were analysed through 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomics, respectively.Results show that the seven plant genotypes clustered in three different phenotypes. The taxonomic diversity and functional genes of bacterial communities differed according to the plant cluster from which they are issued. These differences were explained by the following proteins: (i) Transposase from family Tn3 (bacterial plasmids remobilization), (ii) Membrane receptor TonB dependent (iron) and (iii) metallopeptidases from families TldD/PmbA and M14. Interestingly, TonB dependent transporter proteins seem to be involved in plant-microbe interactions (as this outer membrane protein binds and transports ferric chelates called siderophore, as well as various plant carbohydrates). These results support our initial hypothesis and show that contrasting genotypes modulate microbial gene abundance.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Agro�cologie;Agroecology;;
Papin;Marine;Recurrent inoculation: a strategy for a better survival of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain in soil;Poster;A growing interest is shown for microbial inoculants as a promising alternative to agrochemicals for sustainable agriculture. However, biotic and abiotic stresses are known to affect their establishment and effectiveness, leading to inconsistent performance in field conditions. At the same time, a poor survival of the strain is often observed, which constitutes a main hamper for bacterial inoculant development. We hypothesize that recurrent inoculations would improve the survival of the strain in soil. For this purpose, we tested different scenarios of inoculation of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens in soil microcosms: a single inoculation, two inoculations with a short or long-time interval in between, and four inoculations. We also tested two inoculation densities of the strain. We assessed the survival of P. fluorescens using qPCR targeting a specific gene, and the impact of inoculations on resident microbial community diversity and composition using 16S sequencing. We expect a stronger impact on microbial communities as well as a longer lasting detection of the strain in soils with recurrent inoculations, compared to single inoculation. Generalization of our results to planted soils will be required to better understand the outcomes of a strain inoculation and identify situation-dependent patterns. A great concern should also be payed to the disturbances induced within the resident microbial communities even when the inoculant does not establish, because legacy effects may induce lasting changes in diversity, composition and functioning.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Agro�cologie;Agroecology;;
Petitfourt;Julie;Impact of agricultural chemical inputs on the intestinal microbiota : the example of the yeast Candida albicans;Poster;"The gut microbiota (GM) is a complex and unique ecosystem that plays an important role in host health maintenance and disease pathogenesis. The development of a stable and diverse GM is essential to various host physiologic functions such as immunoregulation, pathogen prevention, energy harvest, and metabolism. Thus, the composition imbalance of the GM, or dysbiosis, leads to the host intestinal homeostasis dysregulation, contributing consequently to the onset or the progression of many diseases. Thereby, a better understanding of factors that influence the composition of GM appears to be essential.
In the past few years, the most studied aspect of the Human exposome influencing the GM composition was the effect of dietary habits. Nowadays, new topic of investigations aim to decipher how the GM manages exposition to other xenobiotics. Among those xenobiotics, the impact of agricultural chemical inputs, including pesticides, remain poorly explored. Recently, the description of the disrupting effect of family members of new generation of pesticides on this fragile balance between the gut barrier and GM was highlighted. Again, only few families of chemicals have been explored to date, including neonicotinoid and pyrethroid, and phenylpyrazole members, largely used in agricultural practices, remain less investigated. In this context, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a member of the phenylpyrazole family, Fipronil, on the major component of the fungal GM, Candida albicans. To assess the impact of Fipronil exposure on C. albicans (SC5314 strain) (i) yeast fitness and (ii) Yeast-to-Enterocyte virulence were evaluated in-vitro. Data support an impact of the Fipronil exposure on C. albicans virulence by modifying their properties of filamentation, invasion and adhesion at the gut barrier. Overall, this study suggests that is essential for the future to study whether or not pesticides trigger dysbiosis of the human GM considered as a whole.";1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Agroecologie;Agroecology;;
Meyer;Cara;Soil microbial community fragmentation reveals indirect effects of pesticide application mediated through biotic interactions between taxa;Poster;In soil ecosystems, microorganisms exist in complex and diverse communities where microbial taxa are linked through different types of interactions. Therefore, pesticide application will not only directly affect certain microbial taxa, but will also have indirect effects throughout the community mediated through these interactions. These indirect effects may also influence ecosystem functions. In this study, a naturally occurring soil microbial community was fragmented by filtering a soil suspension and inoculating sterile soil microcosms. The effect of the fungicide Hymexazol on community structure and function was tested on the separate fractions and on the unfragmented community after a 40-day incubation period. We hypothesized that some taxa within the fragmented community would respond differently to pesticide application than in the unfragmented community, thereby unravelling indirect pesticide effects due to biotic interactions. Microbial communities were analyzed via high-throughput sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes along with differential abundance and network analyses. We found that pesticide effects on microbial diversity vary between the different fractions and that fragmentation reveals pesticide effects that were not apparent in the unfragmented community. This work sheds light on ecological interactions between microbial taxa in soil and provides a novel approach for the development of procedures to assess pesticide toxicity at the ecosystem level.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Agro�cologie;Agroecology;;
Maslard;Corentin;Ecophysiological processes underlying soybean mineral nutrition under individual or combined heat and water stresses;Poster;In a context of climate change with more frequent drought events and heatwaves, it is predicted that soybean yields will drastically decrease in the near future. Soybean being the most widely grown legume crop in the world, there is an urgent need to improve its ability to sustain its growth under such conditions in order to guarantee high levels of productivity.The aim of this study was to explore the influence of heat and/or water stress on soybean growth and its water and mineral nutrition. Two soybean genotypes displaying contrasted abilities to resist to these stresses during their vegetative growth were grown in a greenhouse under either optimal conditions, heatwaves, water stress, or both heatwaves and water stress. The genotypes were compared for their shoot and root plasticity, their mineral uptake and use efficiencies, and their water management at the whole plant level.This study highlighted plant strategies promoting soybean growth under these two stresses and offered new perspectives for crop adaptation to climate change.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Agro�cologie;Agroecology;;
Chaudron;Zoe;Identification and functional characterization of S-nitrosated proteins from Klebsormidium nitens, a model alga to study plant adaptation to land;Poster;The small gaseous molecule nitric oxide (NO) is well established as a major ubiquitous component of cell signalling. A key signalling mechanism mediating NO effects is S-nitrosation, a post-translational modification by which NO can impact the target protein activities, subcellular localizations, and capacities to form protein complexes. The identification of proteins targeted by NO is of major interest in order to elucidate NO functions. Interestingly, land plants lack NO synthase (NOS), which is the main enzyme for NO synthesis in metazoans, while a few algal species possess it, thus raising many interrogations. Therefore, we focused on the identification of S-nitrosated proteins during salt stress in Klebsormidium nitens, a freshwater algal species possessing a NOS and established as a model to study plants adaptation to land. We applied the Biotin Switch method followed by mass spectrometry analysis. This method allows the purification of S-nitrosated proteins. We found 43 proteins with significantly higher S-nitrosation levels in salt response condition. Orthology analysis were performed against the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, therefore we established a classification of these proteins according to their localization, molecular function and biological process they are involved in. This is done with the PANTHER classification system, based on Gene Ontology terms (GO terms). Then, from this list, we selected an interesting protein called INOSITOL POLYPHOSPHATE MULTIKINASE 2a/b (IPK2a/b), potentially involved in cell signaling and stress response. We produced it in Escherichia coli and are currently measuring its activity. This protein will then be Snitrosated in vitro and we will determine if its activity is impaired. Through the identification and functional analysis of Snitrosated proteins in K. nitens, this project will provide a better understanding of the functions of NO in unicellular green algae with NOS.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Agro�cologie;Agroecology;;
Hobloss;Samir;Oleanane-type glycosides from two cultivars of Weigela florida : ?Minor black? and ?Brigela?;Poster;Saponins are triterpenoid glycosides known for their vast panel of biological activities, among which their defence role against phytopathogens1. The Weigela genus has been the subject of several studies leading to the isolation of such triterpene glycosides2. Thirteen saponins were thus extracted from two Weigela cultivars: Weigela florida ?Minor black? and ?Brigela?.Four of the extracted molecules were never reported in the literature before: 3-O-?-D-xylopyranosyl-(1?4)-?-Dxylopyranosyl-(1?3)-?-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1?2)-?-D-xylopyranosyloleanolic acid, 3-O-?-D-xylopyranosyl-(1?4)-?-Dxylopyranosyl-(1?3)-?-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1?2)-?-L-arabinopyranosyloleanolic acid, 3-O-?-D-xylopyranosyl-(1?4)-?D-xylopyranosyl-(1?4)-?-D-xylopyranosyl-(1?3)-?-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1?2)-?-L-arabinopyranosyloleanolic acid, and 3O-?-D-xylopyranosyl-(1?4)-?-D-xylopyranosyl-(1?4)-?-D-xylopyranosyl-(1?4)-?-D-xylopyranosyl-(1?3)-?-Lrhamnopyranosyl-(1?2)-?-L-arabinopyranosyloleanolic acid.Their full structural elucidation, reported in this article, required extensive 1D and 2D NMR experiments coupled with mass spectrometry analysis. Four molecules among the known ones were in sufficient amount to be tested for their antifungal activity against Candida albicans, and their antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While none of these molecules showed any interesting effect, those results made it possible to corroborate some hypotheses that were made regarding the structure/activity relationship of saponins.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Agro�cologie;Agroecology;;
Nazaryan;Samvel;The phytochemical characterization of medicinal plants used in the ethno-medicine of Armenia;Poster;Scabiosa caucasica (Armenian chrysanthemum) and Scabiosa ochroleuca are a perennial species, native of subalpine meadows in the northern Caucasus and Transcaucasus. They are wild Scabiosa growing in high mountain meadows over 2 500 metres elevations in Lori, Syunik, Tavush, Aragatsotn, Gegarkunik, Vayots Dzor and Shirak regions of Armenia. The Armenian chrysanthemum is most commonly known for its properties of curing irritation of the skin, such as scabies. They are generally used as a herbal tea to combat the feelings of influenza. The extraction of Scabiosa caucasica and Scabiosa ochroleuca was performed by maceration and Microwave-assisted extraction. Further separations, purifications and identifications were performed by different type of preparative and analytical tools. Vacuum liquid Chromatography was used for the separation in large scale according the polarity of molecules, followed by Sephadex separation by molecular weights of molecules and Medium Pressure Liquid Chromatography purification (more accurate technique than VLC) according polarity of molecules. Adaptation of solvent system with high polarity for the separation and purification was sign of polar saponin. The structures of purified saponins were elucidated by analysis of 1D and 2D-NMR (1H?1H COSY, TOCSY, HSQC-TOCSY, HSQC, ROESY or NOESY, and HMBC) spectroscopic data and mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS). Five molecules of saponin were identified with oleanolic acid as aglycon part. One of them had 7 glycosides attached to aglycon (5 glycosides attached to C3 and 2 glycosides attached C28) and the rest 8 glycosides attached to aglycon (6 glycosides attached to C3 and 2 glycosides attached C28).;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Agro�cologie;Agroecology;;
Mater;Adrien;Effect of pedalling cadence during eccentric cycling on oxygen consumption and perceived exertion;Poster;"For a given power output, changing the cycling pedalling rate alters factors such as perceived exertion, oxygen consumption or muscular activation. While this observation holds for traditional (i.e., concentric) cycling, no data are available for eccentric cycling (ECC), even though this exercise modality has been extensively studied in the last decade, especially in the rehabilitation field. Notably, the effects of ECC cycling cadence on oxygen consumption (VO2) and perception of effort (PE) remain unknown. In the current investigation, twelve participants completed four sessions one week apart: 1) determination of maximal concentric aerobic power (MAP); 2) familiarization with ECC cycling at five cadences (30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 rpm); 3) and 4), ECC cycling exercise consisting of 5 min at the five different cadences at either 40 or 60% MAP. PE was reported and VO2 was calculated over the last minutes of exercise. PE and VO2 were higher at 60 than 40% MAP (P < 0.05). Both factors showed an effect of cadence (P < 0.003) and followed a U-shaped curve. Lower values of VO2 appear at 60 and 75 rpm. At a cadence of 30 rpm, the resulting PE was greater than at all other cadences. To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the effects of cadence on both VO2 and PE, for ECC cycling at different power outputs. Both PE and VO2 were affected by cadence. As lower ECC cadences require greater force production on the pedals, these likely involve the recruitment of additional motor units, as evidenced by an increased EMG (not presented here). In addition, a greater motor command would be related to higher VO2 and PE. Conversely, high ECC cadences may require a suboptimal muscle contraction pattern that would increase energy expenditure compared with intermediate cadences and then increase VO2.";1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Cognition, Apprentissage et Mouvement;Cognition, Learning and Mouvement;;
Pineau;Antoine;Effect of combined electrical stimulation and muscle lengthening on torque development;Poster;Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) elicits muscle contractions through peripheral (motor axons? depolarization) and central (sensory axons? depolarization) pathways. The use of wide-pulse duration delivered at low intensities results in contractions mainly originating from a central pathway and gives rise to the phenomenon of extra torque (ET). However, ET is not present for all subjects. Combining a technique that enhances the activation of these afferent pathways, such as muscle lengthening (LEN), could facilitate ET generation. The study aimed to evaluate the combined effect of these two modalities (NMES + LEN) on torque development and associated neuromuscular changes.Fourteen subjects participated in one experimental session consisting of 20-s stimulation trains delivered over the tibial nerve at 20 or 100 Hz (1-ms pulse duration, intensity set to evoke ~10% of maximal voluntary contraction). During these stimulation trains, the ankle joint was either moved (180�/s) from a stretched position (80�) to the reference position (90�) (shortening, SHO), either from a shortened position (100�) to the reference one (lengthening, LEN) or maintained constant at 90� (isometric, ISO). The torque-time integral (TTI) was calculated (TTILEN, TTISHO, TTIISO) and was expressed as a percentage of the TTI of the ISO condition. Spinal excitability (maximal H-reflex normalised with respect to the maximal M-wave, i.e. Hmax/Mmax) was assessed at rest before and after each stimulation train.Results showed that TTILEN was higher than TTISHO during low-frequency (P<0.05), while there were no significant differences during high-frequency NMES. These results indicate that low-frequency NMES combined with LEN increases the developed torque, while there is no effect of superimposed LEN with highfrequency. This can be explained by a possible saturation of the afferent pathways limiting further torque increase. Spinal excitability remained unchanged suggesting that inhibitory and facilitatory phenomena at the spinal level were similarly modulated by both low and high frequency.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Cognition, Apprentissage et Mouvement;Cognition, Learning and Mouvement;;
Barbusse;Denis;Kinematic adaptation to a normal but negative gravitational field: feedforward or feedback control?;Poster;"As humans, our ability to move is a vital and essential function whose refinement results from years of adaptation and evolution. Since gravity is ubiquitous, our central nervous system has naturally learned to make the most of it by optimising its effects to minimise the cost of our actions. Amongst other results, the optimal integration of gravity in motor control is highlighted by variations in the temporal organisation of arm kinematics according to movement direction (Gaveau et al., 2016). Indeed, gravity assists downward movements and resists upward movements, which translates into longer and shorter acceleration phases, respectively. This direction-dependent difference is called Directional Asymmetry and has been shown to reflect how much motor patterns optimize gravity effects to minimize muscle effort (Gaveau et al. 2016). Motor control studies in altered gravity demonstrated that arm kinematics rapidly adapts to new gravity conditions (Papaxanthis et al., 2005; Gaveau et al., 2016). Surprisingly, very few studies focused on the effects of inverted gravity.Eighteen volunteers were alternatively standing Head-Up and Head-Down, while asked to do vertical one-degree-of-freedom discrete arm pointing movements. To compare motor patterns between orientations and as function of time, directional differences on times to peak acceleration, velocity and deceleration were computed. Our results in the Head-Down condition support a control process that does not optimally integrate gravity effects to minimize muscle effort. Hitherto, only sparse results exist on the effect of an inversion of gravity in the egocentric reference frame. Recent works reveal a reoptimisation of gravity effects (Opsomer et al., 2021). Our contribution further suggests that this reoptimisation occurs during the latest movement phases. This supports the implication of feedback mechanisms and also that our brain uses a representation of gravity effects that not only involves an allocentric but also an egocentric representation (Le Seac?h & McIntyre 2007).";1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Cognition, Apprentissage et Mouvement;Cognition, Learning and Mouvement;;
Mathieu;Robin;Optimization criteria in healthy young people and healthy older adults during various movements;Poster;"The CNS (Central Nervous System) is known to select movement trajectories that optimize some hidden criteria within the environment. For example, it has been shown that arm movement of both young (Gaveau et al. 2014, 2016) and older adults (Poirier et al. 2020) are tuned to harvest gravity effects and minimize muscle effort. The present study tests whether whole-body movement of young and healthy older adults also optimize similar criteria across ages. Previous work suggest that older adults tend to secure their equilibrium instead of trying to minimize the energetic cost of their movements.Ten young (2 females; 25 years old) and 4 older adults (3 females; 80 years old) performed three tasks in a randomized order.i) vertical single degree of freedom arm movements with their two arms; ii) sit to stand and back to sit movements; iii) whole body pointing movements towards an object lying on the ground. We recorded electromyograms signals from 16 muscles using bipolar surface electrodes (1000Hz) and the kinematics of 39 markers using the Plug-In-Gait model from a Vicon motion capture system (200Hz). Each movement was performed at fast and at slow velocity. Using a well-known decomposition method of tonic and phasic electromyographic activities, we computed parameters on negative phases from the phasic electromyograms (EMGs).Older adults tend to show shorter negative phases with a lower amplitude but also with a lower frequency during equilibrium related tasks. That was not the case for arm movements (Poirier et al. 2020). These preliminary results tend to confirm that older adults, when performing a whole-body movement, seem to favor equilibrium control rather than effort minimization. Additional data are being collected.";1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Cognition, Apprentissage et Mouvement;Cognition, Learning and Mouvement;;
Perra;Joris;Eye movements reflect the development of structural processing skills in sight reading of music across expertise levels;Poster;Expert memory theories assume that over the course of practicing a discipline, knowledge structures are built up in long-term memory allowing experts to process domain-specific information in a rapid and structural way (i.e. chunks, templates). In this study, five learning levels of French conservatory from beginners to professional pianists were tested on a sight-reading task in which their eye movements were monitored. In one condition pianists were asked to sight-read classical scores that respected the domain-specific harmonic and rhythmic rules of Western music while in another condition, contemporary scores that did not respect those rules had to be sight-read. First, the results indicate that as expertise in music reading develops, musicians process visual information more rapidly (increasing their played tempo and decreasing their number and duration of fixations allocated per note), more structurally (increasing their eye-hand span) and more accurately (increasing their number of correct played AOIs). Overall, these results are in line with expert memory theories and suggest an increase in structural information processing abilities through the acquisition of music sight-reading skills. Secondly and regardless of their music reading expertise level, musicians were less accurate and showed higher number and duration of fixations when they sight-read the contemporary rather than classical scores. These results are consistent with the hypotheses developed in expert memory theories and suggest in the one hand, that domain-specific visual cues in a given task are crucial for the use of an efficient eye movement behavior in experts, and in the other hand, that eye-tracking is a fairly accurate technique to discriminate musicians according to their structural information processing skills even across the years of learning a discipline.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Cognition, Apprentissage et Mouvement;Cognition, Learning and Mouvement;;
Torres;Julie;High imagery skills increase the pleasantness of visual textures regardless of valence: a matter of processing fluency ?;Poster;Among human senses, touch is one of the least studied, even though touch and vision are complementary senses in many activities. For instance, visual and tactile perception of surface textures conveys important information about the physical world, including pleasantness. This work focuses on the influence of imagery skills on the perception of texture pleasantness without tactile information (such as online activities). To address this question, the influence of individual characteristics on the hedonic judgment of visually displayed textures (cotton, glass, sandpaper?) was investigated through an online study. First, participants were asked to imagine them touching visually displayed textures and to rate their pleasantness. Then, their individual skills related to imagery and touch were assessed using online questionnaires (e.g., sensory imagery, need for touch). Results revealed that imagery skills influence hedonic judgement in the context of mental stimulation of touch. Interestingly, good imagers judge textures more pleasant than poor imagers, regardless of the valence of textures (pleasant, neutral or unpleasant). We discussed the role of processing fluency in mediating the influence of imagery skills on hedonic perception.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Cognition, Apprentissage et Mouvement;Cognition, Learning and Mouvement;;
Bordeau;Camille;Comparison of auditory encodings for visual-to-auditory sensory substitution in a localization task;Poster;Visual-to-auditory sensory substitution devices are assistive tools to help blind people navigate and localize objects. They are based on an auditory encoding which converts visual information into auditory information. This auditory information is not easy to interpret without training.To provide auditory information that is quickly and efficiency interpretable, auditory encoding should be intuitive. An auditory encoding based on a sound spatialization should be intuitive. However vertical position of spatialized sounds is not easy to perceive without any training. To deal with it, we suggest the use of an auditory encoding based on sound spatialization associated with a cross-modal correspondence for vertical axis. The cross-modal correspondence consists in a pitch encoding of vertical axis.In our study, we propose 3 auditory encodings and compare blindfolded participants' interpretation abilities of this auditory information in a localization task. To assess the intuitiveness of each auditory encoding, we compare localization accuracy before and after a short familiarization with the auditory encoding.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Cognition, Apprentissage et Mouvement;Cognition, Learning and Mouvement;;
Iorio;Claudia;The effect of auditory rhythmic priming on motor sequence learning;Poster;Implicit procedural learning is essential for the effortless execution of many everyday life activities. The most popular task used to study this process is the serial reaction time task (SRTT) which is a four-choice reaction time (RT) task in which participants are required to press a button corresponding to the location of a visual stimulus. Unbeknownst to the participant, the positions of the visual stimuli are presented in a repeated sequence. The gradual reduction in RT and errors provides a measure of the learning of the sequence.Previous studies showed that temporally regular auditory presentation induces attention-based temporal expectations that can benefit learning processes, like for instance the implicit learning of an artificial grammar or language. In our study, we investigated whether rhythmic auditory priming could also benefit learning, in particular here the learning of an implicit motor sequence. To do so, we implemented a musical priming Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) in which each block of practice was preceded by a short musical sequence. To study the effect of temporal regularity on the acquisition of the sequence, we compared two groups: while one group was presented with regular musical sequences (with an inter-beatinterval of 500 ms), the other one was presented with irregular musical sequences.We found a significant main effect of learning, but no interaction between regularity (regular vs. irregular) and learning, suggesting that regularity did not influence the ability of participants to learn the sequence. Although our evidence is in line with classic results from the SRTT literature, the non-significant interaction suggests that, in contrast to our hypothesis, regular priming does not seem to have a beneficial effect on motor sequence learning.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Cognition, Apprentissage et Mouvement;Cognition, Learning and Mouvement;;
Ardonceau;Vincent;Aftereffects of vertical prism adaptation on visuospatial representation;Poster;Prism adaptation (PA) is a well-known technique to assess sensorimotor plasticity. It consists in pointing at different targets while wearing glasses that shift the visual field. PA has been well-studied in the horizontal dimension, where adaptation to both leftward and rightward optical deviations induces sensorimotor aftereffects. In healthy individuals, asymmetrical cognitive aftereffects on visuospatial representations can also be found after PA to a leftward, but not to a rightward optical deviation. Less is known in the vertical dimension, where literature is still scarce. Recent outcomes showed that it is possible to develop sensorimotor aftereffects following the adaptation to upward and downward optical deviations. In the present study, we aimed at evaluating whether vertical PA could also produce a visuospatial representational bias, assessed by a manual line-bisection task. In this task, participants were asked to mark the center of vertical lines presented in front of them. Healthy subjects naturally present a small bias toward the higher extremity of the line, named altitudinal bias, due to an overrepresentation of the upper hemispace. Our hypothesis was that adaptation to a downward optical deviation should exacerbate this altitudinal bias, shifting the visual subjective center of the line upwards. At a sensorimotor level, our preliminary results show that vertical PA to both upward and downward optical deviations induced a sensorimotor bias in the opposite direction to the optical deviation. At a cognitive level, PA to a downward, but not to an upward optical deviation, produced representational aftereffects on line-bisection task, shifting the visual subjective center of the line upwards in the vertical line-bisection task. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first proof of cognitive aftereffects induced by PA in the vertical dimension.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Cognition, Apprentissage et Mouvement;Cognition, Learning and Mouvement;;
Compagne;Charline;From behavioral to neural: a systematic review on the adjustments needed to adapt the balloon analogue risk task to neuroimaging studies;Poster;Decision-making is a complex cognitive process that is difficult to evaluate. Several neuropsychological instruments have been developed, including the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), a computerized behavioral task that assesses decision-making function under risk. Recent studies have adapted the BART to neuroimaging in order to reveal functional or dysfunctional brain processes associated to risky behavior. However, various modifications of the paradigm have been proposed to adapt the BART to neuroimaging.Thus, we performed a systematic review based on PRISMA guidelines to focus on the necessary adaptations of the BART software according to the neuroimaging techniques. The research was conducted on the combination of the keyword ?Balloon Analogue Risk Task? or ?BART? with ?EEG?, or ?fMRI?, or ?fNIRS? or 'PET' using PubMed Database.The initial search provided 94 articles, 61 of which were included to provide a qualitative analysis. BART was adapted in four neuroimaging techniques, mainly fMRI and EEG, but also fNIRS and PET. The adaptation to neuroimaging techniques led to optional changes linked to the strategy of analyses, which affects the assessment of risk behavior.The fMRI, fNIRS, and PET studies used essentially the same design without significant change, unlike EEG studies, where a wide variety of protocols was proposed. EEG studies mainly targeted transient responses related to the reward process, whereas spatial imaging techniques (fMRI, fNIRS, PET) identified common patterns of activation during the task, with the involvement of the PFC (dlPFC and vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and striatum regions.To conclude, even if there is no consensus about the most appropriate BART design to study the neural processes of risktaking, our review presents the most common paradigms and their specificities depending on the research objective.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Cognition, Apprentissage et Mouvement;Cognition, Learning and Mouvement;;
Karolkowski;Adeline;Understanding the off-notes and bitterness formation mechanisms of air-classification pulse-based fractions;Poster;Pulses present environmental, food functionality and nutritional benefits. They are rich in proteins, unsaturated free fatty acids, minerals and bioactive compounds. Many forms are now available such as whole seed, flour, starch and protein concentrate or isolate. The air-classification process is based on the separation of the coarse fraction (rich in starch) and the fine fraction (rich in proteins) thanks to centrifugal and gravitational forces. It is an alternative to wet processing that uses solvent and intensive drying. Despite all of the interests, pulses present off-flavours or unpleasant flavours that reduce consumer?s acceptability. Off-flavours are the sum of off-notes (unpleasant odours) due to volatile compounds, and of bitter compounds that activate taste receptors 2 (TAS2R).The aim of this thesis is to identify the molecules involved in the off-flavour perception and to understand their formation mechanism. First, the volatile compounds of different pulse fractions will be extracted by SAFE (Solvent-Assisted Flavour Evaporation) and quantified, separated and identified by GC-MS (Gaz Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry). The origins of these volatiles (free fatty acid and carotenoid oxidation, and degradation of free amino acids) identified in the literature will enable to show differences between the fractions (cultivars, growth conditions, storage, transformation, ?). Moreover, the volatiles involved in the product odour will be highlighted by GC-O (GC-Olfactometry). Then, the potential bitter compounds found in the literature will be identified by NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and quantified by HPLC-UV (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with UltraViolet detector). Their ability to activate the 25 human TAS2R will be tested. Finally, a sensory profile will be conducted with a training panel to characterise the perception of the studied fractions. These data will be correlated with the volatile, the odour-active and the bitter compounds content identified previously, and with a consumer test to highlight the perception related to off-flavours.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Wang;Mei;Role of saliva in perception of astringency in human in function of age;Poster;"Oral astringency is an important sensory characteristic of food and beverages containing polyphenols. Astringency perception in elderly people is not documented. Current hypothesis on astringency mechanism involved aggregation of the mucosal pellicle by tannins and its protective role by salivary proteins in particular basic proline rich-proteins (bPRPs). The aim of the present work was to evaluate sensitivity to astringency in function of age and saliva (flow and composition). Fifty-four panelists including 30 elderly people (age=75�4.2) and 24 young people (age=29.4�3.8) participated in this study. Astringency was evaluated by 2-Alternative Forced Choice procedure using 4 tannic acid solutions (from 0.02g/l to 0.574g/l). Each 2-AFC test was done 3 times and evaluation was performed 3 times in 3 different sessions. Whole saliva was collected for 5 min before and after sensory tests and protein amount was evaluated. The results showed that the astringency threshold was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young group (elderly=0.41 g/l � 0.23, young=0.29g/l � 0.26; p=0.011). No correlation was observed between salivary protein amount and threshold value. However, a negative correlation between salivary flow and threshold value was observed in the young group only (r=-0.44, p=0.029). In order to explain this difference, western-blot methodology was set up to evaluate PRPs amount of 314 salivary samples of subjects. The results showed there was no difference between young and elderly regarding PRPs levels. Surprisingly, a negative correlation between bPRPs levels and astringency threshold was observed in the elderly group. A positive correlation was observed between gPRPs level and astringency threshold in the young group.These results showed a difference in oral astringency perception as a function of age for the first time. While PRPs amounts explain only astringency threshold at the group scale (bPRP for elederly and gPRP for young). Further analysis taking into account other tannin binding proteins (mucins, histatins) should be performed in the future. This difference may be linked to mucins or histatins amount that could differ as a function of age.";1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Bontempi;Charlotte;Diet and odor hedonic ratings: Comparative study between vegetarians, flexitarians, and omnivore;Poster;Hedonic perception (pleasant/unpleasant character) of food odors is considered as one of the most prominent dimensions in eating behaviour. Odor hedonic rating is also well known to depend on several parameters, i.e., odorant stimulus properties, context specificities and subject characteristics. Surprisingly, while the relation between food hedonic estimation and several parameters such as satiety state, body mass index and food intake has been extensively studied, no specific study has considered odor hedonic ratings in relation to diet. Nowadays, a growing number of people attaches importance to animal welfare and animal/environment protection, which impacts their food consumption and led to specific diets such as vegetarian or flexitarian diets. Thus, the aim of the present study was to compare odor hedonic ratings in three populations with regard to diet, i.e., omnivore, vegetarian, or flexitarian diet. Different categories of odors were considered, especially food vs non-food odors, and meat odors vs other food odors. Results showed that vegetarian and flexitarian individuals rated meat odors as more unpleasant than omnivores, while no significant difference was found for other food odors and non-food odors. These findings are discussed in terms of causal relationship between odor perception and diet.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Santoyo-Zedillo;Marianela;Dedicated odor-taste stimulation design for functional magnetic resonance imaging flavor studies;Poster;Flavor can be defined as the mental representation of the sensory inputs that arise while eating or drinking. However, only retronasal olfaction and taste stimulations are strictly necessary to produce it. In order to understand the brain mechanisms supporting flavor perception, neuroscience functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have generally compared a bimodal odor-taste (simultaneously delivered) solution to the unimodal solutions of either taste or odor presented separately, while monitoring blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) as a correlate of brain activity. However, because of fMRI?s sensitivity to head movements artifacts, swallowing, which is an important processing retronasal odor perception, should be adapted (delayed or avoided) to comply with the imaging techniques constraints without compromising retronasal odorant release.To explore the possibilities to overcome those constraints, we performed an experiment to monitor the in vivo temporal release of odorant via the retronasal pathway, using a mock fMRI set up during a bimodal stimulation fMRI-like design. We tested two factors aiming to improve odorant release: 1) either delayed or avoided swallowing, 2) either normal breathing or breathing exercices. Then, we characterized the dynamics of odorant release both during and after stimulation by quantifying the amplitude and the latency of the release of selected volatile organic compounds along the fMRI sequence.Our results confirmed previous observations that showed that swallowing induced a larger amount of odorant release. However, we discovered that it does not provide a constant odorant release along the fMRI brain recording, which is crucial for a good BOLD signal acquisition. Interestingly, by exploring the pre-swallowing phase in the design of delayed swallowing and normal breathing, we could observe several and continuous odorant release peaks. In conclusion, our design could meet the criteria to produce good quality brain imaging to study flavor by allowing retronasal stimulation without swallowing-related motion artifacts.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Cornebise;Clarisse;Red wine extract, a polyphenolic cocktail, could prevent age-related macular degeneration by inhibits VEGF secretion and its signaling pathway in human retinal cells;Poster;Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common reason of blindness in developed countries. It is characterized by damages in the central part of the retina, the macula. This degenerative disease is mainly due to neoangiogenesis via molecular mechanisms involving the production and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These past decades, therapy such as anti-VEGF has been mainly used to reduce neoangiogenesis. Nevertheless, the progression of the disease is often observed without altering vision quality. In order to enhance AMD treatment, attention has been paid to prevention where diet seems to play a preponderant role. Indeed, it has been shown that polyphenols such as resveratrol can prevent VEGF secretion induced by stress from retinal cells. Polyphenols can not only reduce oxidative stress, but also alter cellular and molecular signaling as well as physiological effects involved in ocular diseases such as AMD. In this context, we have investigated the potential effect of red wine extract (RWE), a polyphenolic cocktail, on the secretion of VEGF and its signaling pathway in human retinal cells ARPE-19. The composition of RWE has been characterized quantitatively and qualitatively by High Performance Liquid Chromatography and tandem Mass Spectrometry. We have shown by ELISA and Western blotting that RWE are able to decrease, in a concentration-dependent manner, the protein expression of VEGF-A and its secretion in ARPE-19. This decrease is sustained by the reduction of VEGF-receptor 2 protein expression and phosphorylation. RWE also induce an alteration in kinase pathway activation by preventing the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in ARPE-19. To conclude, our study highlights the potential interest of polyphenolic cocktails in the prevention of AMD.This work was supported by grants from the Bureau Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bourgogne (BIVB), the Conseil R�gional of Bourgogne-Franche-Comt� and the FEDER (European Funding for Regional Economic Development).;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Hayrapetyan;Gayane;"Wine by-products valorisation by supercritical CO2 extraction (SFE); impact of the extraction process on the structure, functionalities and activity of the extracted molecules";Poster;Viniculture is a huge socio-economic activity throughout the world: 57% of worldwide grape production is used by winemaking industry. Winemaking generates huge amounts of wine by-products (waste), as it represents around 20% of total wine production. Winery by-products have a huge potential to be used for the extraction of high-added value components, however they are directly sent to distilleries for alcohol, spirits and piquette production. The treatment of biomass is often challenging due to its complex matrix and composition. Heavy industrialization and associated huge environmental impact led to a reconsideration of traditional chemistry methods.The aim of this work is to valorise valuable components (pectin, grapeseed oil and phenolic compounds) from grape by-products by implementing green chemistry methods such as supercritical CO2 extraction (SFE). Fatty acids were successfully extracted by SFE from grape pomace with only CO2 under 30�C, 400 bar. Water used as co-solvent (10%) in SFE produced a burgundy coloured liquid which contained wine-related phenolic compounds (gallic and caftaric acids, hydroxytyrosol, catechin) detected by U-HPLC. In addition, the coloured extracts underwent a pectin isolation procedure and were freeze-dried. Initial observation of the extracts by FTIR spectroscopy showed a signature similar to industrial pectin. These findings show possible valorisation of pectin, grapeseed oil and phenolic compounds from winery waste.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Puyo;Maelys;Bioprotection and oenological tannins association to protect Rose wine color;Poster;The bioprotection of musts or grapes is a strategy for limiting sulfiting during winemaking and more specifically at prefermentative step. The most preconized yeasts in bioprotection mainly belong to Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Torulaspora delbrueckii species. While previous studies have demonstrated that bioprotectant non-Saccharomyces strains were able to protect musts and wines against microbial spoilage as well as sulfites, they cannot protect must against oxidation which appears to be the main limit of this practice.A combination of antimicrobial activity through bioprotection (inoculation of a Metschnikowia pulcherrima strain on grapes) and the antioxidant properties of low amounts of sulfites or enological tannins have been tested in order to replace or diminish SO2 addition in ros� winemaking (grape variety Pinot Noir) at pre-fermentative steps. This experiment was carried out under cellar condition. Two enological tannins were tested: quebracho tannins belonging to the condensed tannins family and gall nuts tannins belonging to the hydrolysable gallotannins family. Results showed that combination of bioprotection with enological tannins protected ros� wine color similarly as the combination with SO2, which was not the case with bioprotection alone. The color differences observed cannot be explained neither by anthocyanins concentration, nor by phenolic composition of wines. Quebracho tannins seemed more efficient than gall nuts tannins to protect the color of bioprotected ros� wines.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Evers;Marie Sarah;Vitamins in musts : an unexplored field;Poster;Vitamins are major compounds involved in several prime yeast metabolic pathways. Yet, their significance in oenology has remained mostly unexplored for several decades and our current knowledge on the matter is still lacking to this day. While the vitaminic content of grape musts have been approached in these past investigations, their vitameric composition has never even been investigated so far. To shed light on this unexplored field, a novel HPLC procedure has been developed and validated for the simultaneous and direct analysis of 19 different vitamers from 8 different vitaminic groups (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B8, B9, C) in a one-hour chromatography run that was exempted from any treatment of the sample prior to injection. This technique allowed for the characterization of 85 white grape musts from different geographical origins, cultivars and vintages. Noticeable patterns appeared in regard to the grapevines areas of cultivation, suggesting possible leads for further characterization. Overall, vitamins stand as highly diverse and versatile in concentrations, strongly varying between musts. This analytical tool could allow to further define the yeast's nutritional requirements for vitamins, and as such, to better conduct the alcoholic fermentation in oenology in regards to possible deficiencies in grape musts, as well as allowing to investigate the influence held by vitamins in oenology in regards to wine aromatic profiles.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Esoyan;Syuzanna;Migration of chemical elements from ceramics into model wine;Poster;"Clay-based ceramic vessels (jars, pyhtoi, etc.) for wine fermentation and aging processes have been used in several cultures for millennia. This know-how still in practice in several countries of the Armenian highland is gaining worldwide in curiosity, popularity, and interest. Ceramic pots are famous among traditional winemakers for their benefits such as temperature regulation, natural cooling system, favorable oxygen exchange, and impact on pH, which are different from those of stainless steel, wood barrels, or concrete. Despite a 5000-years-old history of the use of clay-ceramic vessels (amongst other in Armenia), there is only few scientific regard on the impact on wine quality. To approach this subject, it is necessary to recourse to many analytical techniques and we only report some results obtained by ICP-AES and proton NMR relaxometry on a model wine. ICP-AES is used to identify the migration of elements from the ceramic to the model wine. The results of the elemental analysis of the model wine in contact with ceramics over time, showed that a large number of elements, were transferred from the ceramic to the model wine with different migration behaviors. The noticeable amount of migrating iron attracted attention. NMR relaxometry is used to follow in situ, the migration of paramagnetic elements (like iron), reduction of iron, but also the consumption of dioxygen in the model wine in contact with the ceramic. It is also shown that coated ceramic (e. g. with bee wax; a traditional Armenian method) can drastically limit chemical exchange.";1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Bachelet;Fanelie;Role of vacuolar sulfate in nutritional quality of pea seeds;Poster;Legumes have a key role to play in both agroecological and food transitions due to their ability to accumulate large amounts of seed proteins without nitrogen fertilization thanks to symbiotic N2 fixation in the root nodules. However, in agroecological systems, legumes are more exposed to nutrient deficiencies, including sulfur deficiency, than in conventional systems, making it important to optimize nutrient use efficiency for maintain seed protein quality, in particular the level of (semi) essential amino acids like methionine and cysteine. These sulfur-containing amino acids are synthetized through the sulfur metabolic pathway starting from sulfate reduction. Sulfate is taken up from the soil and transported in plant parts by sulfate transporters (SULTR) and can be stored in the vacuoles for further remobilization by SULTR4 transporters when sulfur availability remains scarce. Here, we investigated the contribution of vacuolar sulfate to seed yield and quality by using two mutants of the only SULTR4 gene that exists in pea (Pisum sativum). Seed yield of the two mutants was significantly reduced in response to sulfur deficiency, highlighting the prominent role of this transporter in stabilizing seed yield when sulfate is limiting. Interestingly, under sulfur-sufficient conditions, the mature sultr4 seeds accumulate lower amounts of sulfur-rich proteins but displayed a higher sulfate concentration compared to the wild-type seeds. These data and the unchanged sulfur content of the mature sultr4 seeds suggest that vacuolar sulfate remobilization within developing seeds contributes to storage protein synthesis. A gene expression analysis, by qRT-PCR, revealed an up-regulation of genes involved in sulfate reduction and a down-regulation of genes encoding sulfur-rich storage proteins in both mutant seeds. Based on these results, we present a hypothetical model of the impact of vacuolar sulfate in fine-tuning sulfur metabolism and storage protein synthesis during pea seed development. Further experiments are currently performed to confirm this model.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Kuang;Jian;Colloidal interactions between pea globulin isolate and purified egg white proteins;Poster;Partial substitution of animal protein by plant proteins is a new challenge in food formulation. However, previous studies performed separately on plant and egg white proteins cannot help us to have a direct understanding of their functionalities in complex food matrices in which they are used in association. In the present work, to demonstrate the interactions and association in the mixed systems, aqueous suspensions of low denatured pea globulins (PPI) were prepared in admixture with purified egg white proteins (ovalbumin (OVA), ovotransferrin (OTA), and Lysozyme (LYS)). The aqueous mixtures were studied at pH 7.5 and pH 9 in HEPES and TRIS buffer respectively by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), zeta potentiometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS), laser granulometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). ITC demonstrated strong exothermic interactions of the mixture of PPI-LYS at both pH. In contrast, weak interactions were observed for PPI-OTA system at both pH and PPI-OVA system at pH 7.5. No interaction was detected in PPI-OVA system at pH 9. Zeta potential data showed that net positive charge of lysozyme promoted electrostatic interactions with negative charges of pea globulins. Furthermore, DLS and laser granulometry showed that the particle size of mixture increased with increasing LYS to PPI ratio. In addition, the CLSM images revealed that PPI-LYS system formed aggregations as a function of molar ratio of LYS to PPI.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Amat;Tiffany;Functional and nutritional properties of legume proteins as affected by interactions with phytic acid and calcium;Poster;Nowadays, consumer trends are promoting pea and fava bean as alternatives to soybean. Both are rich in proteins and a good source of essential nutrients and minerals such as calcium. Nevertheless, these advantages can be partially impaired due to their high phytic acid content. This natural polyphosphate is a major antinutrient in plant-based foods, as it can bind minerals (in particular calcium) and proteins, thereby reducing their digestibility and subsequent bioavailability. Indeed, complexes formed are insoluble and unavailable for absorption, thus lowering the nutritional value of pulses. Molecular interactions are influenced by environmental factors including pH, ionic strength, temperature and molar concentration, modulating the stability of these complexes during protein extraction and further processing. In particular, ternary protein/phytic acid/calcium complexes stability is of high relevance for food processing, affecting not only the structure but also the functional and nutritional properties of proteins in legume-based foods. Thus, my research focuses especially on the dispersion of pea and faba bean concentrate and isolate powders in water to then quantify the release of proteins, calcium and phytic acid in aqueous phase. The objective is to understand the interactions between all these three elements while taking into consideration environmental factors.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Go�t et Alimentation;Taste and Food;;
Druguet Dayras;Milva;Two thousand years of boreal forests disturbances history: a multi-proxy approach;Poster;Boreal forests occupy 30% of the global forest area and provide many ecosystem services essential to the development of societies (water ressources, timber production, maintenance of global climate balance). Their functioning, structure and dynamics are intrinsically linked to natural disturbance regimes, particularly insect outbreaks and fires. While the dynamics of fire regimes in the face of climate change is fairly well known, insect pest outbreaks are poorly understood, especially for spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana, SBW). Knowledge on the interactions between these two disturbance regimes is lacking as well. This project therefore aims to answer the following question : how have the cross dynamics of these two disturbance regimes responded to past and present climate changes? Paleoecology, through its long-term approach, allows a better understanding of these dynamics. The project will be conducted at large spatial scale in different bioclimatic domains of Quebec, selected as key ecosystems for the understanding of these dynamics. The objectives of our project are (i) to develop a methodology to reconstruct SBW outbreaks over a 1500-year period thanks to qPCR quantification of sedimentary DNA, in order to obtain a complete warming - cooling - warming cycle, (ii) to investigate the interactions between these two natural disturbances over the last 1500 years using sedimentary DNA and macro-charcoals, and (iii) to evaluate the changes in macroinvertebrates communities (diversity and assembly rules) during SBW outbreaks, and the role of these communities in regulating SBW outbreak cycles, using Next Generation Sequencing. This project opens the perspective of a better understanding of the cross dynamics of fires/outbreaks in the face of various past climatic changes, and would thus allow a better understanding and prediction of the impacts of climate warming on forest dynamics in Quebec.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Pal�o�cologie;Paleoecology;;
Boussagol;Pierre;Development and distribution of lacustrine carbonate deposits in the Basin and Range, USA: Impact of climate, tectonics and substrate;Poster;The Basin and Range hosted several continental lacustrine systems that accommodated extensive microbial carbonate deposits: the Lahontan on the western side (since 48 kyr cal BP) and the Bonneville (from 30 to 11.5 kyr cal BP) and Great Salt Lake (since 11.5 kyr cal BP) on the eastern side. While the eastern domain of the Basin and Range shows a transition from freshwater to hypersaline conditions, the western domain does not show any significant change from the originally freshwater conditions. Mapping and characterization of microbial deposits in both domains allows for a comparison between the different lakes and their specific spatial distribution. The morphology, size and distribution of the carbonate deposits is mainly affected by environmental changes (i.e., seasonal to long-term water level fluctuations, particular geomorphological heritage, fault-induced processes, groundwater seepage, substrates) and have the potential to provide further insights into the reconstruction of paleoenvironments and paleoclimatic changes through time. Although all the lakes show a paleoshoreline distribution of some microbial-rich structures (crusts, hemispheroid, and part of domes) related to climatic-induced lake level variations, the presence of columns and complex domes in the western Basin and Range seems related to groundwater influxes. In the west, the Winnemucca and the Pyramid Lakes, with extensive springs on the flexural margin and along faults generate bigger structures than the ones observed in the eastern Basin and Range lakes. This contrast in the distribution, composition, and size of the microbial deposits between both sides of the Basin and Range suggests changes in chemistry, physiography and meteoric/groundwater influxes. Furthermore, this work provides a novel model for the formation of abiotic carbonates in lacustrine settings and identifies the role of microbialites to store carbon.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Pal�o�cologie;Paleoecology;;
Talon;Julien;Significance of a fibrous clay event in the Lutetian-Bartonian deposits (Eocene) of the Paris Basin;Poster;During the Eocene, some major climate events known as hyperthermals following the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Event (PETM), namely the ETM2, ETM3, EECO, LLTM and MECO events are marked by a net increase of temperature and negative carbon isotope excursions highlighting carbon cycle disruptions. Since enhanced continental weathering coupled to an increase of temperature and humidity is observed during most of these events, clay mineralogy and C-isotope geochemistry are useful methods to track such events. We thus investigate these proxies at high resolution in the Le Tillet core (north of Paris) to provide a detailed evolution of clay mineralogy and a first Corg isotope curve spanning the Eocene (Ypresian-Bartonian) to identify possible Eocene hyperthermal events in the Paris Basin.Six successive intervals are recognized based on clay mineralogy. Among them, an episode dominated by fibrous clay minerals (palygorskite and sepiolite) accompanied by smectite and clinoptilolite is recorded during the Lutetian-Bartonian transition (~41 Ma) corresponding to the ?Marnes et Caillasses Formation?. This episode, recognized in other cores and outcrops of the Paris Basin, seems to correspond to the record of an arid climate event in Europe and predates the MECO (Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum) that is marked by the return of more detrital clay mineral and kaolinite input in the basin. Associated to a carbon isotope excursion, this hot and arid episode may correspond to the LLTM event (Late Lutetian Thermal Maximum) previously recognized in the deep oceans.;1;14h20;15h30;Session 1;Pal�o�cologie;Paleoecology;;
Radoua;Abdelmnim;Vectorization of anti-death receptor 4 antibodies on hyperthermia-responsive nanoparticle to increase their therapeutic potential in oncology;Poster;TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand) derivatives are very promising therapeutic agents in oncology. However, despite encouraging results, clinical assessments of the use of the first generation of TRAIL derivatives, including monoclonal antibodies targeting TRAIL agonist receptors (death receptor 4 or death receptor 5), have all been interrupted, mainly because of a lack of efficacy. The various projects developed within the host team suggest that their poor efficiency is essentially due to an inappropriate formulation. The team has demonstrated for instance that the valency of TRAIL agonists needs first of all to be increased, which can be done using nanoparticles, and that intrinsic resistance can be overcome by mild hyperthermia.Based on this strong result, we aim at demonstrating that the functionalization of conformational anti-DR4 (death receptor 4) antibodies, developed by our team together with Covalab on biocompatible magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) or gold nanoparticles (gold nanorods, GNR), capable of locally and remotely activating moderate hyperthermia by phototherapy approaches based on near infrared (NIR) or electromagnetic fields (EMF), will help increase the anti-tumor potential of our agonist antibodies. We are also planning to find out whether any of these antibodies, formulated as indicated above, may serve as diagnostic markers to detect tumors in vivo.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Maladies et Cancers;Diseases and Cancers;;
Bouchard;Alexanne;Glycoprotein-A repetition predominant, a target of interest for SPECT imaging of triple negative breast cancer;Poster;Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer associated with the highest probability of metastasis and a lack of specific targets. Glycoprotein-A repetition predominant (GARP) is expressed at the membrane of cancer cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). GARP plays a critical role in the activation of TGF-? contributing to tumor progression and invasiveness. Further investigation of the modulation of TME and its follow-up by molecular imaging appear as valuable tools due to its central role in TNBC.Methods: Membrane expression of GARP was analyzed in 4T1 cells by flow cytometry. In parallel, eight weeks old BALB/c (n=6) and swiss nude mice (T cell deficient mice, n=6) were injected with 5x104 4T1 cells in the mammary fat pad. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4T1 tumors to detect the presence of GARP and FoxP3, a marker of Tregs. To design a GARP specific probe for Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging, a commercial anti-GARP Fab fragment antibody was conjugated with a chelating agent (DOTAGA) for radiolabeling with 111Indium. 111In DOTAGA-Fab-GARP was injected intravenously in BALB/c and swiss nude mice (100?l, 10MBq, 50?g), and mice underwent SPECT imaging at 1h, 4h and 24 post-injection.Results: Our results demonstrated that GARP was expressed by FoxP3+ Tregs and weakly by 4T1 cancer cells suggesting that GARP may be essentially expressed by Tregs in the TME. SPECT imaging showed an increase in 111Indium-Fab-GARP uptake in tumors of BALB/c mice compared with nude mice demonstrating the specificity of our probe for Tregs.Conclusion: In vivo molecular SPECT imaging targeting GARP, could represent an interesting approach to determine tumor aggressiveness, treatment options and therapeutic responses, in a non-invasive, rapid and personalized manner.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Maladies et Cancers;Diseases and Cancers;;
Renaude;Elodie;Epigenetic reprogramming of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from liver metastases;Poster;The different subpopulations of CD4+ helper T cells (CD4+ Th) present in the tumor microenvionment such as Th1 and Th17 cells can affect differently the prognosis of patients. Numerous studies described the beneficial role of Th1 cells infiltration in the tumor. Moreover, previous work in our lab associated the presence of Th17 cells in liver metastases of colorectal cancer with a poor prognosis.Th17 cells are characterized by their plasticity and can differentiate into Th1 cells thanks to epigenetics. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications play an important part in the regulation of CD4+ Th differentiation and plasticity. However, the role of epigenetics on the antitumor specific immune responses remains poorly characterized.To bring answer to this issue, our team is investigating the role of epigenetics in tumor reactive CD4+ Th cells differentiation and plasticity. We performed a screening of 360 epigenetic regulators by flow cytometry and discovered a molecule that can decrease the proportion of Th17 cells and increase the proportion of Th1 cells in healthy donors.Modulating CD4+ Th cells polarisation in the tumor microenvironment by epigenetic drugs could offer new insights in anticancer therapy. The rest of our work will focus on understanding the epigenetic mechanisms allowing the plasticity of Th17 and Th1 cells. We aim to test our molecule in a mouse model of cancer in order to increase the effectiveness of anticancer immunotherapy treatment.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Maladies et Cancers;Diseases and Cancers;;
El Baba;Ranim;Oncogenic, stemness and polyploid giant cancer cells phenotype in mammary epithelial cells infected with high-risk human cytomegalovirus;Poster;Over the last decade, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection has been increasingly implicated in carcinogenesis besides its oncomodulatory impact. Two high-risk HCMV strains, DB (KT959235) and BL (MW980585), previously isolated in our laboratory transformed human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) into CMV-Transformed HMECs (CTH) cells, prompted an oncogenic phenotype, induced stemness traits, and generated breast tumors in mice models. CTH heterogeneous cell population phenotype might be described by the dynamic cellular reprogramming and the giant cell cycling, where the induction of polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) could expedite the acquisition of malignant phenotype. Further, two HCMV strains isolated from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) biopsies were shown to replicate in MRC5 cells and transformed HMECs toward CTH cells. The explicit oncogenic and stemness signatures of the high-risk HCMV strains highlight the oncogenic potential of HCMV in breast cancer evolution thus paving the way for novel therapeutic agents and clinical interventions which will extend the overall survival of breast cancer patients.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Maladies et Cancers;Diseases and Cancers;;
Perus;Maude;Omega-3/Resveratrol combination (Resvega ) reduces angiogenesis axis and oxidative stress in in vitro models of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD);Poster;"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease, which targets the macula and thus impairs vision in the center of the visual field, and affects around 200 million persons in the world. During the last decades, despite recent advances in understanding the role of oxidative stress and excessive production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for AMD initiation and progression, therapeutic advances still face many challenges. Although intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors has become the standard treatment for neovascular AMD, many patients do not respond adequately to this therapy or experience a slow loss of efficacy of anti-VEGF agents after repeated administration. Additionally, current treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents is associated with a significant treatment burden for patients, caregivers, and physicians. In quest of identifying novel therapeutic candidates for AMD, our study explored whether supplementation with Resvega®, a nutraceutical formulation composed of omega-3 fatty acids and resveratrol, a polyphenol in grapes, was able to counteract VEGF/VEGFR-2 axis, in context of AMD. We highlight that Resvega® significantly reduced VEGF production in ARPE-19 human retinal pigment epithelial cells. This effect is directly linked to the Resvega®-mediated relocation of VEGFR-2 in lipids rafts (LR), which favors, interaction between the LR marker protein caveolin-1 (CAV-1) and VEGFR-2, leading in turn the decrease of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and down-stream signaling. The impact of Resvega® is exclusively dependent of LR as depletion of LR with cyclodextrin blocked the VEGFR-2/CAV-1 interaction and Resvega®-mediated impaired VEGF production. Interestingly, we highlight that Resvega® decreases H202-induced ROS production, which is an

Dogon;Geoffrey;Exogenous Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) exerts direct cardioprotective properties towards myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury;Poster;Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) is a stress-responsive cytokine which can be produced under certain pathological situations, mainly related to inflammatory stress, aging and disease. While clinical data suggest that GDF15 is a powerful risk factor in several high cardiovascular risk situations, experimental studies rather consider this cytokine as a cardioprotective molecule.We therefore aimed to clarify the direct cardiac effects of GDF15 during ischemia-reperfusion (I-R), at concentrations found in patients with high cardiovascular risk.In vivo ischemia reperfusion: Wistar male rats (200-340 g) were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected with either saline or 2.5 ?g/kg of GDF15, 20 minutes before the transient ligation of the left anterior descending artery for 30 min followed by 24h of reperfusion.Ex vivo ischemia reperfusion: Wistar male rats (250-400 g) were anesthetized with isoflurane before their hearts were isolated and perfused in a Langendorff model. Hearts were perfused either with saline or 2,000 ng/L of GDF15 upstream the coronary bed for 10 minutes, then subjected to 30 minutes of global normothermic ischemia, followed by 2 h of reperfusion.GDF15 decreased the infarct size in vivo (42.4 � 6 % vs. 65.3 � 4.5 %, p<0.01) as well as in ex vivo (45.6 � 3.8 % vs. 60.8 � 3.8 %, p<0.05). Moreover, in our ex vivo model, GDF15 induced a better recovery of most contractile parameters after ischemia (higher left ventricular developed pressure, better heart rate recovery, better recovery in left ventricular contractility and relaxation, p<0.05 for all parameters).These results demonstrate for the first time that exogenous preischemic short-term administration of GDF15 decreased cardiac cell death in vivo and also ex vivo, a situation where inflammatory, endocrine and nervous systems are not interfering. These original results suggest that GDF15 exerts direct cardioprotective properties towards ischemia-reperfusion injury. The molecular mechanisms have now to be investigated.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Maladies et Cancers;Diseases and Cancers;;
Sikner;Hugo;Inhibition of Gp96 as anti-fibrotic strategy in Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and its monitoring by Fibroblast Activation Protein in vivo imaging;Poster;Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease characterized by excessive Extracellular Matrix production (ECM) deposition in the lung leading to functional decline. Under the influence of pro-fibrotic cytokines such as TGF-?1, lung cells acquire a myofibroblastic phenotype which express the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and play an important role in ECM deposition. Treatment options in IPF are limited and can only delay disease progression without stopping it. Gp96 is a chaperone protein overexpressed during fibrosis.Gp96 inhibition may be of interest in IPF and we hypothesize that in vivo imaging of myofibroblasts via FAP could allow monitoring of the efficacy of this therapy.Methods: Eight weeks old C57BL/6 mice received a single intratracheal administration of bleomycin (BLM, 1.5 mg/kg, n=6) to induce lung fibrosis or Nacl (n=6) for control group. Immunohistochemistry was performed on lung slices of this model to detect FAP expression. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to study protein-protein interactions between Gp96 and FAP on A549 cell (epithelial cell) treated with TGF-?1 and pu-ws13, a functional inhibitor of Gp96. A FAP specific imaging probe was designed based on a fragment of a commercial antibody coupled with a chelating agent (DOTAGA) for radiolabelling with 111Indium for Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. 111In-DOTAGA-Fab-FAP was injected intravenously in C57BL/6 mice (100?l, 10MBq, 25?g). Mice underwent SPECT imaging at 1h, 4h and 24h post-injection.Results: Our results demonstrated FAP upregulation in the lung of our model. Moreover, PLA demonstrated an interaction between Gp96 and FAP reduced by pu-ws13. SPECT imaging showed a statistically higher uptake of 111Indium-Fab-FAP in the lungs of fibrotic mice versus control mice.Conclusion: Inhibition of Gp96 represents an innovative anti-fibrotic strategy and in vivo imaging of myofibroblasts via FAP appear able to monitor the efficacy of this therapy in our IPF model.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Maladies et Cancers;Diseases and Cancers;;
Chatturong;Usana;Vasorelaxant effect of 2 new N2,N4?diaminoquinazoline analogs on rat isolated intrapulmonary arteries and mechanisms involved;Poster;While phosphodiesterase?5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil, are ?gold standard? for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), they induce side effects secondary to their vasorelaxant effect on systemic vasculature such as hypotension, headache or nasal congestion. We developed new N2,N4?diaminoquinazoline analogs as PDE 5 inhibitors and identified 2 compounds (ID5 and ID11) with a high PDE5 inhibitory activity and vasorelaxant effects on pulmonary artery. The present study aimed to determine the mechanisms involved in their relaxant effect on IPA, to check their lack of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) cytotoxicity and to determine if they had a relaxant effect on the systemic vasculature, as compared to sildenafil. Vascular function was studied in rat isolated IPA (pulmonary vasculature), aorta and second-order mesenteric arteries (SMA) (systemic vasculature). Cytotoxicity was measured in rat VSMC using MTT assay. ID5 and ID11 had more potent vasorelaxant effect on IPA compared to aorta (p<0.001), while sildenafil was not different between IPA and aorta. In SMA, ID5 and ID11 induced less relaxation compared to sildenafil (p<0.01). The relaxation to ID5, ID11 was reduced by endothelial removal, nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor or guanylate cyclase inhibitor (p<0.0001) but not by cyclo-oxygenase or K+channels inhibitors in IPA. ID5 and ID11 enhanced sodium nitroprusside-induced IPA relaxation, suggesting PDE5 inhibition. Both compounds inhibited extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ release (p<0.001). ID5 and ID11 had no cytotoxicity on VSMCs whereas sildenafil at 100?M for 1h reduced IPA VSMC viability (p<0.05). In summary, ID5 and ID11 possess more selectivity on pulmonary circulation over systemic circulation than sildenafil and do not induce vascular cytotoxicity. Besides acting on PDE5 and calcium fluxes in VSMC, they also enhance endothelial function through NO-dependent mechanisms. Thus, they could be potential leads for developing new PAH therapeutics.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Maladies et Cancers;Diseases and Cancers;;
Tahri-Joutey;Mounia;Impact of peroxisomal ?-oxidation deficiencies on lysosome and autophagy in microglial cells;Poster;Deficiencies in acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), the first rate-limiting enzyme of the peroxisomal ?-oxidation, or in ATP Binding Cassette D1 (ABCD1), one of the peroxisomal fatty acids transporters, are rare and severe peroxisomal neurodegenerative diseases. Such deficiencies are associated with defects in degradation of fatty acids (VLCFA, PUFA) by ?-oxidation in peroxisomes, which leads to the accumulation of VLCFA in plasma and tissues, glial dysfunction and neurodegeneration.CRISPR/Cas9-engineered microglial cell lines deficient in ACOX1, ABCD1, ABCD2 or both ABCD1 and ABCD2 were used as cell models to investigate the dysregulation of cellular pathways triggered by lipid accumulation. Transcriptomic analyses (RNA-Seq), Western blot, GC-MS analysis, as well as phagocytosis function tests were performed to better understand the physiopathogenesis linked to these peroxisomal deficiencies.Our analyses show biochemical defects and lipid content changes in mutant cells, as well as an overexpression of several lysosomal and autophagy related genes at post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. Furthermore, experiments conducted with fluorescent beads reveal a remarkable change in the phagocytosis ability of mutant BV-2 cells compared to the wild type. Altogether, we suggest that a defect in peroxisomal fatty acid ?-oxidation in microglial cells impacts phagocytosis, lysosomal function and autophagy process in microglial cells. Further experiments are needed to strengthen our understanding of these major cellular processes lying behind these significant cellular changes, and to aid in the development of new treatments for such rare human diseases.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Maladies et Cancers;Diseases and Cancers;;
Lagorgette;Lisa;The role of Wip1 in neutrophil functions;Poster;Every day, organisms are exposed to injuries that induce many cellular responses. One of the major consequences of these stresses is the induction of DNA damage, which involves a lot of proteins and cellular signaling such as the p53 cellular pathway. The protein Wip1 is a phosphatase that regulates negatively the p53 pathway and controls many cellular mechanisms. Recently, we have demonstrated the role of Wip1 in tumor infiltrating neutrophils through genetic deletion of its chemical inhibition ability involved in anti-tumor phenotypes and tumorigenesis suppression. Representing the biggest part of immune cells in the human blood, neutrophils play a key role in homeostasis and immunity. NETosis, a type of cell death that contributes to the host defense against pathogens, has been linked to various diseases soon after its first description in 2004. During NETosis, neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which consist of modified chromatin decorated with bactericidal proteins originating form granules and from the cytoplasm. Considering that Wip1 is induced by DNA damage and its role in neutrophils, studying the role of Wip1 in NETosis mechanisms makes sense. Here, neutrophils from blood donors were isolated and treated with PMA in presence or absence of Wip1 inhibitor. After having quantified NETosis with several methods, Wip1 inhibition seemed to enhance NETosis in presence of PMA. These findings from our in vitro model need to be verified in Wip1 KO mice, and in physiological and pathological contexts where neutrophils play a significant role, such as cancer or inflammatory diseases like fibrosis.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Maladies et Cancers;Diseases and Cancers;;
Baraille;Marylou;Comparison of in vitro fibrolytic capacity of the large intestinal microbiota in aged versus adult horses;Poster;Plant cell walls play an essential role in the horse?s nutrition. They are degraded by the microbiota that inhabit the large intestine. In humans, aging is correlated with changes in gut microbiota structure and diversity. Such modifications in aged horses could affect plant cell walls degradation, and consequently impair the hosts? nutrition and general condition. The objective of this in vitro study was to compare the intestinal fibrolytic function of aged versus adult horses.Eight aged (26 � 3 years) and eight adult (7 � 1 years) healthy horses were fed an identical diet (26 % concentrate and 74 % forage) for 3 weeks before faeces were collected. Individual faecal inoculum was added to vials containing a fibrous substrate. Microbial fermentation was evaluated at different times (T) for 72 hours (T72) by measurement of gas production, pH, and dry matter (DM) disappearance. A mixed procedure was performed to assess the effects of age, time, and their interaction. The significance threshold was set at P ? 0.05.Cumulative gas production was higher for aged than for adult horses at T48 (P = 0.0076), T60 (P = 0.0010), and T72 (P = 0.0008). In parallel, pH was lower for aged than for adult horses at T72 (P = 0.0042), and DM disappearance was higher for aged than for adult individuals at T48 (P = 0.0168) and T72 (P = 0.0372).These results suggest that, contrary to our hypothesis, the large intestinal microbiota of aged horses has a more efficient fibrolytic function than that of adults. With aging, a selection of the most effective microorganisms may have occured. These first results will be completed with data obtained in vivo in order to assess other differences between the digestion and metabolism of aged versus adult horses.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Microbiologie;Microbiology;;
Vasseur;Maximilien;Relations between hindgut microbiota fibrolytic efficiency and physical performance in equine athletes;Poster;"During short duration exercise in the horse, muscles mostly use glucose and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) as energy substrates. Blood SCFA mainly originate from dietary fibers degradation by the microbial communities located in the hindgut. When blood SCFA concentration increases, glucose contribution to energy metabolism decreases, which results in lower lactate production and delayed metabolic acidosis. Hindgut fibrolytic efficiency could play a crucial role in horse?s performance by enhancing SCFA production. This experiment aimed at assessing the relationship between in vitro fibrolytic efficiency of individual hindgut microbiota and running performance.Seventeen trained 2 years old French trotters with similar feeding and training regimen were included in this experiment. Individual faecal samples were collected and added in bottles containing a dilution medium and hay as substrate. Gas production was measured in each bottle during 48h (T0 to T48) anaerobic fermentation. In parallel, horses performed a 2300 m racing like test at maximum capacity. Mean and maximal running speeds and fermentation parameters were correlated using calculation of Pearson correlation coefficients.Mean speed during the 2300m test tended to be correlated with cumulative gas production at T36 (r=0.466; P=0.068) and is significatively correlated with gas production at T48 (r=0.517; P=0.048). No relationship was found between maximal speed during the 2300m test and fermentation parameters.These first results suggest that horses whose faecal microbiota produced a higher amount of gas could have better racing performance. As hay was the only substrate in bottles, a higher gas production after 36 or 48 h of fermentation probably reflected a better fibrolysis and a higher SCFA production, confirming that hindgut fibrolytic efficiency could be related to horse performance. Further studies should explore in vivo the link between these fermentation parameters, blood metabolites and performance.";2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Microbiologie;Microbiology;;
Pheng;Th?-Thanh-Trec;Selection of encapsulation materials for protection and colonic delivery of extremely oxygen sensitive probiotics;Poster;Colonic administration of extremely oxygen sensitive probiotics with agreeable barrier properties of encapsulating materials is a matter of great concern. There have been many previous studies on certain biopolymers. However, the comparison, evaluation and selection of materials for probiotic encapsulation is difficult because the results of the different studies were not carried out under the same experimental conditions. Therefore, this study was conducted simultaneously on many different polysaccharides (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, chitosan, lowmethoxylated pectin, kappa-carrageenan, sodium alginate and pullulan) to provide compelling conclusions for the selection of encapsulating materials based on oxygen and water vapor barrier properties and release profiles of the core materials from polymer matrices in the gastrointestinal tract. The results revealed that chitosan, low-methoxylated pectin, kappacarrageenan, sodium alginate and pullulan films exhibited good oxygen barrier properties to protect strictly obligate anaerobes. Among all the polymers tested, sodium alginate exhibited the best oxygen barrier properties and release profile. The release kinetics can be modulated by several factors including polymer type, plasticizer concentration and active molecules or bacteria to be encapsulated. On that basis and integrating the other parameters analyzed, a multicriteria strategy for probiotic encapsulation was proposed.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Microbiologie;Microbiology;;
Martinho De Brito;Marlisa;The role of EPS in carbonate precipitation during picoplankton blooms: Combining laboratory and field studies;Poster;Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are complex macromolecules involved in different processes such as biofilm formation and mineral precipitation. EPS is produced during microbial growth, and the amount and the proprieties depend on environmental conditions, such as nutrients, light, and pH. Excessive production of EPS can occur during phytoplankton blooms under nutrient or light limitation. High rates of CO2 uptake during blooms increase the pH, in some cases (e.g., freshwater systems) reaching values of 9-11. At high pH conditions, negatively charged functional groups in EPS bind Ca2+ ions and support formation of CaCO3 crystals. Late-exponential phase of cyanobacterial blooms (e.g. Synechococcus) might coincide with massive carbonate precipitation events in freshwater lakes. The mechanisms involved in the bacterial carbonate precipitation focuses predominantly on inorganic carbon metabolism and the role of EPS has been largely ignored. In this study, we investigate the seasonality of cyanobacterial EPS production and its potential role in CaCO3 precipitation. Our site is a slightly-alkaline freshwater lake in the French Jura, Lac d?Ilay (46.625825N, 5.8966637E).EPS properties, including the role in carbonate precipitation, were investigated in shallow water samples. Microscopic analysis of lake water revealed the presence of coccoid cyanobacteria (<2?m) clustered in concentric layers of mucilage (<10?m). Precipitation of ?m- and nm-size CaCO3 crystals attached to the EPS matrix were also observed in water samples from the lake. The EPS yield in the upper water column was 1.4�0.1mg EPS.L-1. The total sugar content was 2-3 times higher than protein content and glycosaminoglycans contributed with 8-14% of total EPS. Alcian Blue staining of polyacrylamide gels revealed negatively-charged functional groups in molecules of high molecular weight (>170kDa). Forced CaCO3 precipitation experiments revealed that total crystals formed decrease with increasing EPS concentration. We are presently continuing this work by investigating EPS properties during seasonal picoplankton growth. We hypothesize that in addition to cyanobacterial CO2 fixation, EPS play a critical role in carbonate precipitation and thus potentially contribute to the carbon budget in freshwater lakes.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Microbiologie;Microbiology;;
Gaillot;Susie;Cloning and characterization of ADC variants found in clinical Acinetobacter baumannii strains;Poster;The emergence of antibiotic resistance is a concerning health problem. The World Health Organisation classified the most threatening species under the name ESKAPE. Among them, Acinetobacter baumannii, a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for health-care associated infections, is highly capable of developing antibiotic resistance. A. baumannii naturally produces an enzyme called ADC, which is chromosomally encoded and hydrolyses few beta-lactams. The main mechanism leading to resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (normally active against A. baumannii) is the overproduction of ADC. Multiple ADC-variants have been identified but little is known about the impact of the amino-acid substitutions on their hydrolytic properties.In this study, we assessed the resistance phenotypes of 9 distinct ADC variants by cloning the corresponding genes in a pABEC plasmid then transformed in the recipient strain A. baumannii CIP70.10?ADC. Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of selected antibiotics (ticarcillin, cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, imipenem, and cefiderocol) were determined using the standard microdilution method.Overproduction of all the ADC-variants leads to higher MICs of ticarcillin, cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and piperacillin/tazobactam compared to those obtained for the reference strain. In addition, one variant (ADC-256) displayed a decreased susceptibility to meropenem (MIC increasing from 0,125 to 8 ?g/ml). Another variant (ADC-33) was also the only enzyme to show a decreased susceptibility to cefiderocol (MIC ranging from 0,5 to 2 ?g/ml).Analysis of the amino-acid sequence of ADC-33 revealed that this variant possessed a substitution located in the ?-loop, a region close to the active site, that could therefore have an impact on cefiderocol decreased susceptibility. This is worrisome considering this antibiotic has just recently been accepted on the market. This study highlights the importance of the overproduction of ADC inexpanded-spectrum cephalosporins and revealed that some amino-acid substitutions in those intrinsic beta-lactamase could directly be involved in the antibiotic resistance phenotype.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Microbiologie;Microbiology;;
Etchart;Lea;Incubation behaviour and importance of extended recesses in an Arctic shorebird: The sanderling (Calidris alba);Poster;Sanderling shorebirds (Calidris alba) undertake a spectacular long migration to reach the Arctic where they breed during the short summer. In this harsh and unpredictable environment, incubation is challenging due to high energetic demands and variable resource availability. Incubating adults hence face a time allocation compromise between parental care to their eggs (maintenance of optimal thermal environment and nest protection) and feeding away from the nest to meet their own energetic needs (recesses). Recesses durations are known to be highly variable between individuals, with a mean duration of eight minutes. Until recently, extended incubation recesses where incubating shorebirds are away from nests for periods much longer than usual (period of time superior to one hour), were considered to occur infrequently. Although there is growing evidence that extended recesses would not be so rare, their quantification and determinants remain poorly documented. By monitoring the incubation behaviour, we are studying the incubation strategy and more specifically the importance of extended incubation recesses as well as their causes and consequences.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Divers;Miscellaneous;;
Sidous;Mellina;Assessing predation risk of arctic fox and other terrestrial predators on sandpiper (Calidris spp) nests in the arctic tundra;Poster;"The arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) is recognized as the main terrestrial predator on most tundra?s ecosystems. It relies heavily on small rodents such as lemmings for breeding, but also consumes a variety of alternative food sources when available (e.g., bird eggs or carrion). Changes in arctic fox behavior and demography induced by lemming population cycles may alter predation pressure on incidental (or ""accidental"") prey, such as Calidris nests, consumed opportunistically when encountered.Since predation by arctic fox is supposed to be the main driver of Calidris nests failure in the arctic, the estimation of its rate has received a lot of attention. However, it is often difficult and time consuming to find and monitor natural nests, which usually results in analysing only small sample sizes. Other protocols have thus been proposed to estimate predation risk, e.g. artificial nests or observational data of predators. Our goal is to assess whether these two protocols are efficient to estimate trends of predation risk on Calidris nests across years that are characterized by varying abundance of alternative and primary prey of the arctic fox. Using artificial nests (including ?covered? ones, supposed to be only predated by foxes) and observational data (of arctic foxes and other predators like skuas, gull, raven, etc), we tested whether Calidris nests failure rate was better explained by artificial nests or observational data with capture recapture analysis. Our data also allowed us to test if nest survival is actually more related to index of fox predation risk than other predators, as often believed in the literature. Here we present the first results of this joint initiative and its future challenges.";2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Divers;Miscellaneous;;
Cramoisy;Stephanie;Chronic corticosterone administration in mice alters behavioural strategy implementation by modifying striatal-dependent motor and cognitive activity;Poster;Chronic corticosterone administration (CCA) mimics excessive activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in rodents, resulting in a pathological phenotype commonly used to model human distress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression. Previous studies conducted in our laboratory demonstrated that CCA negatively impacts motor and cognitive processes in mice, and leads to suboptimal decision-making in particular. However, further investigation is needed to better characterize these impairments. The present study further evaluated the consequences of CCA on the balance between habits and goaldirected behavioural strategies in adult C57BL/6JRJ male mice. Dorsal striatum-dependent habit learning was assessed using a cross-maze-based single-solution paradigm (response learning) and a rotarod motor learning task. Thereafter, a dual-solution task (place learning) enabled additional examination of the balance between striatum and hippocampus-dependent strategies. Since behavioural control necessary for adaptive decision-making is supported by both learning processes, this study will allow identify the approach distressed mice mostly rely on: a striatum-based egocentric strategy or a hippocampus-based allocentric one. Our preliminary data indicate that CCA leads to delayed striatum-dependent learning in both the motor and response learning tasks, in line with a delayed behavioural initiation during the decision-making process. Furthermore, the indecision observed in some distressed mice could refer to a difficulty in implementing a decision-making strategy. Thus, our results support that CCA modulates learning by regulating the striatum-hippocampal balance. Imbalanced striatum-hippocampus-dependent behavioral strategies might therefore underlie aberrant decision-making induced by chronic distress in pathological conditions.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Divers;Miscellaneous;;
Boichot;Valentin;Characterization of human oxidoreductases ability to interact with odorous molecules in olfactory cleft;Poster;Flavor is mainly driven by binding of odorous molecules on olfactory receptors. These molecules must cross the mucus barrier before to reach the olfactory receptors. This barrier contains many proteins and among them are found xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) such as aldehyde dehydrogenase and aldo-keto reductase. XMEs aim is to defend organism from reactive chemicals, which can be toxic, and to participate to the clearance mechanism. Previous studies demonstrated that some XMEs like GSTs, are able to interact with odorous molecules in the olfactory cleft (mucus and epithelium). The purpose of this research is to highlight the contribution of two aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1A1 & ALDH3A1) and one aldo-keto reductase (AKR1B10) in the peripheral olfactory process. Using a multi-technique approach (proteomic, immunohistochemistry, activity assays and crystallography), our results suggest that these three enzymes are able to contribute to the peripheral olfactory process by metabolizing odorous molecules (better affinity for aldehydes) in olfactory cleft and therefore to modify the quantity and quality of odorants which can bind on olfactory receptors.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Divers;Miscellaneous;;
Lutet-Toti;Camille;Zero pollution: recycling sea by-products of shellfish farming - Search for bactericidal biomolecules in the shell of mollusks of economic interest;Poster;To calcify their shells, mollusks secrete macromolecules (mainly proteins) that regulate the deposition of the crystalline units and remain occluded in the mineral phase. Until recently, the function of these macromolecules was thought to be essentially related to calcium binding, to the interaction with temporally amorphous calcium carbonate nanograins, or to the elaboration of membranes around crystalline units. High-throughput proteomics techniques backed by transcriptomes show the complexity of this calcifying matrix, which has many molecular functions, including potential bactericidal capacity revealed by the presence of highly basic peptides contained in the matrix.This exploratory research seeks in a first step to demonstrate in vitro the bactericidal capacity of calcifying shell matrices extracted from mollusks of economic interest (mussel, oyster, clam, scallop, sea almond, etc.). The second step focuses on application tests on various models: effectiveness as growth factors, protective pigments, algicides, or in stemming the bioerosion of carbonated geomaterials by endolithic microorganisms (in particular perforating cyanobacteria). This research project is at the interface of environmental (geo)sciences, aquaculture, conservation and health, but also of museology and cultural heritage preservation sciences. Its purpose is to valorize - through a sophisticated application - a very abundant coproduct of the sea: the empty shells from common shellfish consumption which are only recycled with low added value (soil amendment, poultry feed supplements, coastal embankments). Thus, in the medium term, this project aims to establish a virtuous circular economy.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Divers;Miscellaneous;;
Pinault;Lise;Contribution of French peatlands to the carbon neutrality national goal in 2050;Poster;Disturbed peatlands contribute to global warming by releasing important amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Restoring the hydrological functionality of peatlands is an efficient tool to limit these emissions. In France, Tuffnell & Bignon ministerial report (2019) emphasized the need to integrate peatlands in National Low Carbon Strategy, targeting carbon neutrality by 2050. To help decision makers and managers in prioritizing areas for restoration, knowledge of French peatlands, total carbon stocks and their vulnerability is essential. Old and rough estimates from a 1949?s inventory show that French peatlands inventoried at that time covered around 100,000 ha and contained at least 101.6 MtC, with main stocks being located in lowland regions as Normandy or Picardy. However, these data no longer reflect the current situation of French peatlands and carbon stocks. Therefore, the aims of our project are to build a decision-making tool in collaboration with stakeholders, using a bottom-up approach based on regional inventories aggregation. The implementation of a typology relying on operational indicators (water depth, typical peatland vegetation?) will reveal the state of degradation of French peatlands. This national inventory of peatlands will inform us about carbon stocks distribution across France and, by highlighting most disturbed sites and main CO2 emitters, will allow us to predict CO2 emissions from peatlands at multiple scales for the next decades, in the absence of restoration actions. Finally, the database will include priorization criteria such as property status, land use or price of land, influencing restoration costs thus feasibility of restoration operations.;2;11h50;12h50;Session 2;Divers;Miscellaneous;;
Chavanton;Aude;Tumor-derived exosomes: Hidden players in PD1/PD-L1 resistance;Oral;Immunotherapy has garnered increasing importance in cancer therapy, leading to substantial improvements in patient care and survival. However, while patients generally respond well to immunotherapy such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1, a proportion of patients present tumors that resist to these treatments. Exosomes, small nanovesicles secreted by tumor cells, could be key actors in this resistance. We identified immunosuppressive molecules (IM) expressed by tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) in different types of cancer (melanoma, lymphoma, lung and colon cancer).Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and evaluated by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA technology) and TEM. Isolated exosomes were tested for the expression of exosomal markers (TSG101, CD9, CD63, CD81, Alix, Grp94). IM concentration in exosomes were measured using an ELISA. T-cell and MDSC activation/ proliferation were observed by flow cytometry.First, we explored the action of exosomal molecules on the immune system both in vitro and in vivo. We found that TEX have immunosuppressive properties like the cancer cell from which they are derived at inhibiting T-cell activation determined by the expression of PD-1, Ki67, granzyme B and IFN?.In addition, we noticed that TEX can also activate myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs activation leads to global immunosuppression of immune cells (T-cell, macrophages, and dendritic cells) independently from the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. We have developed an inhibitor of this TEX/ MDSC pathway and demonstrated in mouse models that the decrease in MDSC was associated with tumor regression and with intratumor infiltration of immune cells (T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages).Finally, we conducted a clinical trial to observe these immunosuppressive TEX in cancerous patients.Altogether, these results show that exosomes derived from cancer cells are able to mediate immunosuppression. Further studies of TEX are needed to better understand resistance under anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.;1;16h50;9h45;Session 1;Canc�rologie 1;Oncology 1;;
Hibos;Christophe;Role of NOD-like receptor 3 in CD8 T cell biology;Oral;In anticancer immune response, CD8 T cells are known to improve patients? prognosis when they infiltrate the tumor. They can target cancer cells, be cytotoxic and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. The selection pressure exerted by immune cells on cancer cells leads to a dysfunctional immune response. This phenomenon, called immunoediting, is achieved through the loss of cytokine secretion, cancer recognition, and through the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as TIM-3 or PD-1. Immunotherapies targeting those biological parameters showed promising results, but unfortunately, only 20% of the treated patients displayed durable responses.NLRP3 is a protein involved in the early inflammatory response. It is known for its functions in the inflammasome in myeloid cells, where NLRP3 triggers caspase-1-mediated IL-1? and IL-18 secretion. Our team showed that NLRP3 can also play a role in Th2 lymphocyte differentiation, as a transcription factor (Bruchard et al., 2015).Here, we showed in CD8 T cells that NLRP3 is expressed following the activation of the Il-2/STAT-5 pathway. We also demonstrated, thanks to pharmacological inhibitors, that NLRP3 degradation is regulated by autophagy.In order to study anticancer immune responses, our team has developed a model of CD8 T conditional NLRP3 knock-out mice (CD8creNlrp3flox). We managed to show in vivo and in vitro that NLRP3 deficiency in CD8 T cells increases their intratumor population in a mouse model of colorectal cancer, and also makes them more inflammatory and less dysfunctional over time, resulting in a better antitumor immune response and improved control over tumor growth.Our work exhibits for the first time an uncanonical immunosuppressive role of NLRP3 in CD8 T lymphocytes, whose expression seems regulated by autophagy.;1;9h48;10h03;Session 1;Canc�rologie 1;Oncology 1;;
Durand;Manon;Targeting HSP110 in combination with Selinexor in Primary Mediastinal B-cell lymphoma inhibits STAT6 activation and impairs lymphoma cell growth;Oral;Primary Mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is a subtype of Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). PMBL is derived from a thymic B cell and is responsible of only 10% of DLBCL, making it a rare lymphoma. XPO1 is an exportin that mediates proteins transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It is mutated in 25% of PMBLs and is associated with tumour aggressivity. This protein has a chemical inhibitor that is used in therapy: Selinexor. The viability of PMBL cells depends on the constitutive activation of the IL4-R pathway leading to the phosphorylation of STAT6.HSP110 is a heat shock protein known to chaperone mutated proteins in cancers and is known to favour the constitutive activation of the main survival and proliferation signalling pathways of cancer cells. This characteristic has led to the development by our team of a specific chemical inhibitor. My project investigates the chaperoning role of HSP110 towards the PMBL keys proteins: XPO1 and STAT6.Using RNA interference, several viability and proliferation assays, we demonstrated the dependency of PMLB towards HSP110 survival and proliferation. Proximity ligation assay and co-immunoprecipitation showed that HSP110 interacts with XPO1 and STAT6. The direct interaction of HSP110 and STAT6 was confirmed by an in vitro thermophoresis experiment. By treating PMBL cells with HSP110 inhibitor and/or Selinexor, we showed the necessity of HSP110 and XPO1 for STAT6 phosphorylation. Finally, we showed a strong decrease of tumour progression in chicken embryo xenografts when HSP110 and XPO1 inhibitors were used in combination.In conclusion, HSP110 is an essential protein for PMBL survival, through its interactions with STAT6 and XPO1 and its requirement for STAT6 phosphorylation. Combining Selinexor and HSP110 inhibitors could be a new therapy for PMBL.;1;10h06;10h21;Session 1;Canc�rologie 1;Oncology 1;;
Arslan;Sergen;Molecular signature and effect of exosomes from human papillomavirus type 16-infected cells;Oral;A persistent infection by high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the etiologic factor of cervical cancer. The viral genome integration into the host cell induces the continuous and deregulated expression of E6/E7 viral oncoproteins, leading to cellular immortalization, transformation, and maintenance of the transformed phenotype leading to cancer development. Cancerous cells secrete and release extracellular vesicles including exosomes from endosomal origin and especially that transport bioactive molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids in biological fluids. Tumor-derived exosomes are involved in the different steps of tumor progression by delivering their internal content to recipient cells, altering their properties. Specifically, they influence tumor microenvironment to create favorable conditions to the establishment of pre-metastatic niches. Today, few data are known about exosomes from HPV-infected cells: it is essential to understand their role. In this study, we isolated extracellular vesicles by differential ultracentrifugation from HPV16-infected cervical cancer Ca Ski cell supernatants. Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing analysis of isolated fractions showed that they were enriched in particles with a size corresponding to exosome size (60-180 nm). The identification of exosomal markers (CD9, CD81, CD63) by western blotting proved the enrichment in exosomes of isolated fractions. Exosome content analysis detected viral transcripts of e6/e7 oncogenes by RT-qPCR. However, E6/E7 viral oncoproteins were not observed in exosomal fractions. Moreover, the internalization of fluorescent Ca Ski exosomes by HPV-negative target cells was visualized by confocal microscopy. In these recipient cells, HPV16 e6/e7 transcripts were detected and this was associated with an increase of the cell number. Now, it remains to demonstrate that HPV16 transcript delivery is at the origin of the observed biological effect and impact tumor microenvironment, to understand its involvement in HPV-associated tumor development and to determine whether exosomes from HPV16-infected cells could be predictive biomarkers of the evolution of pre-cancerous lesions to cervical cancer.;1;10h24;10h39;Session 1;Canc�rologie 1;Oncology 1;;
Rouch;Laly;Soil organic carbon storage capacity of old and modern wheat varieties;Oral;Despite the possible mitigation of carbon emissions by favoring carbon transfer to terrestrial carbon sinks, little is known about the capacity of different crop genotypes to enhance soil carbon sequestration. We hypothesize that carbon sequestration potential linked to old wheat varieties (released before 1960) is higher than the one linked to modern ones while old varieties are known to develop bigger and deeper root systems. Moreover, modern varieties are often cultivated using synthetic chemical inputs known to modify soil carbon dynamics. We conducted a field experiment by cultivating four modern and four old wheat varieties, with and without chemical inputs (nitrogen, herbicide and fungicide), in Calcaric Cambisol conditions. After root and soil sampling, root morphology was assessed by image analysis, whereas potential catabolic activities by soil microbial communities was assessed by MicroResp ? measurements. Additionally, CO2 emissions measurements were done by incubating soil and roots from each agronomic modality. Results suggest that the genotype (old versus modern varieties) did not affect root traits nor substrates respiration, but the soil from old variety modalities released 6% more CO2 than the one from modern ones. Application of inputs did not affect root traits, but increased soil microbial respiration by 11%. Inputs also increased the respiration of citric acid by 19.1%, while it decreased respiration of fructose and alanine by 8.84% and 16.79%, respectively. Taken together, our results invalidate the hypothesis that old varieties could be more performant than modern ones in storing carbon in this specific soil.;1;9h30;9h45;Session 1;G�ologie et botanique;Geology and Botany;;
Bonnefoy-Claudet;Clement;Effect of changing forest management on organic carbon stocks and Q10 parameter in a beech forest in the East of France;Oral;Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are constantly increasing in the atmosphere and are responsible for increasing temperatures and disrupting biogeochemical processes. One way to reduce these effects is to store carbon in soils, especially in forest soils, which account for 40% of continental terrestrial carbon stocks. Forest soils contain a lot of carbon, but less is known about the effect of forest management on soil carbon stocks. In this study, we compared two plots of forest side by side with different forest managements. The first one is a regular managed forest and the other one is an unmanaged forest since thirty years. To compare these two plots, soil physicochemical characteristics (pH, soil carbon and nitrogen content, ?13C isotopic composition), carbon organic stocks as well as the Q10 parameter were measured. The Q10 parameter is an indicator of the reactivity of organic matter and was estimated by laboratory incubations. Physicochemical results show little difference between the two plots and therefore no difference in carbon organic stocks. The Q10 parameter also showed no difference. These results could be explained by not enough time elapsed since the change in management and/or by too little difference between the two types of management. It would be interesting to compare other plots with longer periods of contrasting forest management or with greater differences in forest management.;1;9h48;10h03;Session 1;G�ologie et botanique;Geology and Botany;;
Chatelain;Pauline;Role of nitric oxide synthases from Klebsormidium nitens: Structural characterization and identification of protein partners;Oral;Nitric oxide (NO) is an important cellular signalling molecule regulating various physiological processes, in both animals and plants. In animals, NO synthesis is mainly catalysed by NO synthase (NOS) enzymes. During biotic or abiotic stresses, NOS-like activities that are sensitive to mammalian NOS inhibitors have been detected in plants, although no sequences encoding the well described mammalian NOS are highlighted in land plants. Interestingly, we identified NOS-like sequences in 20 algae species. Among them, NOSs are found in Klebsormidium nitens the model alga to study the early transition step from aquatic algae to land plants.As mechanisms governing NO synthesis and signalling in green lineage remain unclear, the study of NOSs from K. nitens (KnNOS) through (i) characterization of their nucleotide and protein sequences, (ii) their expression levels, and (iii) the identification of partners proteins might be an important breakthrough knowledge. To achieve this goal, nucleotide sequences were verified by RACE-PCR and sequencing, and after cloning, tagged-proteins were produced. Then the identification of protein partners will be performed by pull-down experiments followed by mass spectrometry analysis.Currently, after re-annotating the nucleotide sequence of KnNOSs, a yeast His-tagged protein production strategy has been adopted. While waiting for the final results of the KnNOSs interactome, an in sillico study was conducted using the BioGrid database and human NOS interaction data. This finding opens the way for a deeper characterization of KnNOSs and its protein partners and will facilitate further investigation of NO signalling in green lineage.;1;10h06;10h21;Session 1;G�ologie et botanique;Geology and Botany;;
Roudaire;Thibault;Two grapevine immune receptors discriminate structurally close chitooligosaccharides;Oral;The establishment of defense reactions to protect plants against invading pathogens first requires the recognition of MicrobeAssociated Molecular Patterns (MAMPs), detected by plasma membrane-bound Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs). These MAMPs, also termed elicitors, are used in several biocontrol products that are gradually developing to reduce the use of chemical pesticides in agriculture. Chitin, the main component of fungal cell walls, as well as its deacetylated derivative, chitosan, are two chitooligosaccharides (COS) that can be found in some of these products. Unfortunately, the mechanism allowing the perception of these molecules is still poorly understood in Vitis vinifera, sometimes hampering the improvement and the generalization of these emerging crop protection tools. On the contrary, chitin perception in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is well described and relies on a tripartite complex formed by three membrane-bound LysM ReceptorLike Kinases named AtLYK1/CERK1, AtLYK4 & AtLYK5, the latter having the strongest affinity to chitin. In grapevine, COS perception has for the moment only been demonstrated to rely on VvLYK1-1 & VvLYK1-2, two constitutively expressed genes that did not specifically respond to pathogens according to genes expression analysis. In this context, we performed experiments to complement the Arabidopsis lyk4/5 double mutant, which showed altered response to COS, by overexpressing their grapevine orthologous genes (VvLYK4-1/4-2/5-1/5-2). Our results revealed that MAPK activation and defense gene expression were restored after a COS treatment by the complementation with two of them, one for the chitin responses and another for the chitosan responses. These preliminary results seem to indicate that the perception of chitin and chitosan in grapevine does not involve the same receptors. FRET-FLIM experiments initiated with these co-receptors as well as the generation CRISPR-Cas9 Knocking-Out lines will soon provide additional information to better decipher the mechanism of COS perception in grapevine.;1;10h24;10h39;Session 1;G�ologie et botanique;Geology and Botany;;
Panklai;Teerapap;Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition and vasorelaxant effects of Nymphaea pubescens petals extract and its main compound;Oral;Aims: Nymphaea pubescens petals (NP) extract was reported to have acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-diabetic, and hepatoprotective. But there is no reported effect on the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibition. PDE5 inhibitors have been used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction or pulmonary arterial hypertension. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the PDE5 inhibitory activity and vasorelaxant effect of NP extract and its main compound (quercetin 3methyl ether 3-O-?-xylopyranoside).Materials and methods: Ethanolic extract of NP was studied on PDE5 inhibitory activity using the two-step radioactive assay and vascular effects (0.001-1,000 ?g/ml) on rat isolated pulmonary artery (PA) and aorta from male Wistar rats. The content of its main compound was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography.Results: NP extract and main compound showed IC50 of PDE5 inhibition at 6.37 � 0.7 ?g/ml and 5.63 � 0.20 ?M, respectively. In addition, NP extract relaxed endothelium-intact arteries with EC50 of 0.005 � 0.001 mg/ml and 0.027 � 0.008 mg/ml in PA and aorta, respectively. Interestingly, main compound developed similar vasorelaxant activities in PA and aorta, with EC50 of 0.029 � 0.004 mM and 0.023 � 0.005 mM, respectively. As concern, the HPLC analysis, range of linearity was from 5 to 400 ?g/ml, with the correlation coefficient (r2) shown as 0.9997. Limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0.85 and 2.82 ?g/ml, respectively. Intra- and inter-day precisions were shown as %RSD and both of them were less than 3%. The accuracy expressed in terms of %recovery was shown between 85.13 -100.97%. NP extract contained main compound was 17.305 � 0.051 mg/g.Conclusions and perspectives: Our data suggested that the HPLC methods were appropriate to determine content of NP main compound. Ethanolic extract of NP and its main compound induced relaxation on PA and aorta, however the mechanisms of which remain to be determined.;1;10h42;10h57;Session 1;G�ologie et botanique;Geology and Botany;;
Dahmani;Justine;Nutritional quality and greenhouse gas emissions of vegetarian and non-vegetarian school meals: a case study in France (Dijon);Oral;Since 2018 French national regulation has imposed that school canteens must serve at least one vegetarian meal per week in order to reduce their environmental impact. However, a lunch without meat is often perceived as inadequate to cover the nutritional needs of children. The present study aims to compare the nutritional quality and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) of vegetarian and non-vegetarian school meals served at school canteens in Dijon, France.The 249 menus served in 2019 were provided by Dijon catering department. Nutrient composition and GHGE of each meal component (starter, protein dish, side dish, dairy product, dessert) was retrieved from national food databases: Ciqual 2020 and Agribalyse 3.0, respectively. For each meal component, we considered the standard portion size recommended by the relevant French authority (GEMRCN). Meals were classified into vegetarian meals (n = 66), i.e., without meat or fish, or non-vegetarian meals (n = 183). The nutritional adequacy of the meals was estimated by the Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR) calculated as the mean percentage of daily recommended intakes for 23 essential nutrients. GHGE of the meals were calculated as the sum of GHGE of each meal component.On average, a non-vegetarian meal covered 50.6% (SD 6.2) of the recommended daily intakes for 23 nutrients while a vegetarian meal covered 48.4% (SD 5.5) (p = 0.010). On average, a vegetarian meal emitted 0.89 kgCO2eq (SD 0.29) while a non-vegetarian meal emitted 2.10 kgCO2eq (SD 1.03) (p<0.001). These analyses show that both vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals were of good nutritional quality (yet slightly lower for vegetarian meals) but that GHGE were more than twice as low for vegetarian meals. Thus, increasing the frequency of vegetarian meals at school canteens would strongly reduce GHGE while maintaining a good nutritional quality.;1;9h30;9h45;Session 1;Nutrition et Alimentation;Nutrition and Food;;
Arrazat;Laura;What about sustainability of university students' dietary habits? A literature review of students' food practices;Oral;In order to mitigate the environmental impacts of food systems, while ensuring food security, a transition towards sustainable diets is essential. Sustainable diets were defined in 2010 by the FAO and encompasses four dimensions: nutritional, environmental, economic and socio-cultural. The younger generation and more specifically students are considered as key actors of this transition. Indeed, they are going through identity development and major changes in their eating habits. The aim of this study was to identify the existing knowledge regarding students? dietary practices and their determinants.We carried out a narrative literature review on students? dietary practices considering the four dimensions of sustainability and based on the COM-B (Capacity Opportunity Motivation-Behaviour) framework, we identified the determinants of these dietary practices to highlight facilitators and barriers of sustainable eating during the student period.Results from studies conducted in Western countries have shown that students? diets are mainly characterised by a low nutritional quality. This latter is influenced by students? social relations and their economic resources. However, it was shown that students have a good nutritional knowledge and are aware of environmental issues. It may suggest numerous obstacles limiting the adoption of sustainable eating practices. Lack of accessibility to sustainable food options near university campuses, limited financial resources and poor culinary skills are the main barriers mentioned in the literature.The results of this review gave us an insight on how to initiate a transition towards more sustainable diets in this population. Consequently, we suggested a series of interventions that could act on the food choice environment as well as at the individual level. Finally, we identified gaps in the literature such as a lack of data, especially quantitative, regarding the sustainability of students? food practices. More specifically, there was an absence of data regarding dietary practices of French students.;1;9h48;10h03;Session 1;Nutrition et Alimentation;Nutrition and Food;;
Carballido;Laura;Development of an intelligent packaging to monitor food degradation and reduce food waste;Oral;"Intelligent packaging are materials ?which monitor the condition of packaged food or the environment surrounding the food? (EC 450/2009). Many examples have been developed in the recent years such as time-temperature indicators to help consumers know the perfect temperature to drink a bottle of wine; cold-chain break indicators, which are labels able to change their colour if the cold chain has been broken; or Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags to allow a better traceability of products.The aim of my thesis is to develop an intelligent packaging able to inform its user about food freshness in real time to ensure food safety while reducing food waste. In fact, many products are wasted because of miscomprehension of the ?Best-before? dating and excessive precautions. Developing an intelligent packaging to monitor food spoilage could be an asset for the food industry.The developed technology consists in a material to integrate to usual food packaging capable of changing its spectroscopic properties in presence of food degradation markers. The designed material is finally able to monitor food degradation in both direct and indirect contact with the food product.";1;10h06;10h21;Session 1;Nutrition et Alimentation;Nutrition and Food;;
Hayrapetyan;Ruzanna;Non-intentionally added substances from food contact coating extracts and safety assessment;Oral;Non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) can migrate from can coatings to food resulting consumer?s exposure. Hazard assessment of NIAS remains difficult as scarce information is available about their origin, formation, toxicity, identification and quantification methods.The objective of this study was to identify and characterize NIAS from metallic food packaging to protect the safety of consumers. Migration tests were performed with acetonitrile and ethanol (95%) for one non-coated control plate and one single polyester coated tin plates (5 different batches). Extracts were then concentrated and analyzed by liquid chromatography?high resolution mass spectrometry in a non-targeted way.Four cyclic oligoesters (1 tetramer and 3 hexamers) were identified with the concentrations in the range of 40-85 ?g/dm2 for 3 of them and 3.2- 6.2 ?g/dm2 for the last one. Several in silico software (VEGAHUB, SARAH and DEREK) were combined to predict the toxicity of the identified oligoesters. Predictions were positive for carcinogenicity and developmental toxicity for some of them. In vitro genotoxicity NanoAmes test was performed using three strains of S. Typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA97a) with and without metabolic activation system to test genotoxicity of the extracts. A negative response was obtained for all extracts.To confirm in silico predictive results, in vitro Cell Transformation Assay will be performed to verify the potential carcinogenicity of the extracts. To date, we are running GC analysis on different extracts to identify other NIAS.;1;10h24;10h39;Session 1;Nutrition et Alimentation;Nutrition and Food;;
Mao;Socheata;Development of a method to screen lactic acid bacteria beta-glucosidases involved in the presence of volatile compounds of fermented vegetables;Oral;Fermented vegetables have gained large attention in studies on lactic acid fermentations for their health benefits and organoleptic properties. Their content in volatile compounds contributes to their flavour, and thus to the buying decision of consumers. Volatile compounds are produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) which come from the environment and the fermentation matrix. They can be considered unfavourable and/or favourable. ?-glucosidases are enzymes produced by LAB that play an important role in generating volatile compounds. They hydrolyse glycosidic bonds to release ?-D-glucosides from terminal non-reducing residues. Most LAB harbor several genes encoding ?-glucosidases. However, the distinct roles of these enzymes, and particularly their substrate specificity, are not well known. Hence, it is not possible to predict their function based on their amino acid sequences. The objective of this study is to develop a method for screening ?-glucosidases in a large panel of LAB isolates from various traditional fermented products in order to ferment cucumbers. This work is divided into four steps: (1) bioinformatic analysis of the diversity of LAB ?-glucosidases sequences to find their conserved domains, (2) use of molecular biology tools to check the presence of ?-glucosidases in new LAB isolates, (3) use of different substrates to study the specific activity of the identified ?-glucosidases sequences in LAB isolates, and (4) inoculation of strains with potential favourable specific ?-glucosidases in fermented cucumbers and analysis of the volatile compounds produced using gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). In conclusion, being able to screen LAB ?-glucosidases according to their substrate specificity could participate in improving the flavour of fermented foods. The combination of experimental work and bioinformatics while studying LAB ?-glucosidases would also provide more insight into the relationship between specific ?-glucosidases and evolutionary conservation of LAB.;1;10h42;10h57;Session 1;Nutrition et Alimentation;Nutrition and Food;;
Salvi;Juliette;Microglia, a new player in the control of satiety;Oral;Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that monitor the environment. They are the first line of defense in all CNS disturbances. Microglia are also involved in the brain control of energy homeostasis. Importantly, microglia appear as a relevant target during the pathogenesis of nutritional obesity. Nevertheless, involvement of microglia in the control of feeding behavior during normal physiology is still unknown. Here, we explored the role of microglia in the short-term regulation of food intake upon standard (SD) or high-fat (HFD) diets.Using immunolabeling, 3D reconstruction and morphometric analysis of microglia located in the hypothalamus, a major brain feeding center, we found that microglia changed their shape within three hours after food consumption. Postprandial changes in microglial morphology (processes with higher length and ramification) were exacerbated by HFD compared to SD. Moreover, magnetic cell sorting on hypothalamic biopsies revealed a postprandial increase in IL-1? mRNA induced by HFD and derived exclusively from CD11b+ (microglial) cells. These data indicate that microglia become reactive and proinflammatory rapidly after HFD consumption.In order to better understand the microglial function, we genetically ablate ASC, an essential component of intracellular inflammasome, in microglia in mice. We generated ASC microglial conditional KO (AscMgKO) mice in which ASC was deleted specifically in CX3CR1+ cells after tamoxifen induction in adult mice. Five weeks after tamoxifen injections, genetic recombination persisted in microglia while it disappeared in monocytes according to specific cell renewal. Finally, food intake of AscMgKO mice was normal under SD but increased under HFD. This hyperphagic behavior under HFD reveals that microglial ASC is involved in the acute homeostatic response to dietary fat, limiting excessive calorie intake during short-term HFD.These findings reveal that microglia are reactive after food consumption, and that microglial inflammasome contributes to the regulation of energy homeostasis during normal physiology.;1;11h20;11h35;Session 2;Neurobiologie;Neurobiology;;
Urban;Jeanne;Exploration of CYP27A1 function in eye cholesterol signaling between glia and neurons in Drosophila;Oral;Cholesterol is essential to maintain the integrity of cell membranes and plays important roles in neuron viability and transmission of nervous signals. In mammalian brain, a fine regulation of its metabolism is associated with the communication between glial cells and neurons. The dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis is associated with many neurodegenerative disorders [1]. In particular, cholesterol accumulation in the retina is implicated in age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of vision loss in western countries [2]. In normal condition, cholesterol elimination from the retina could rely on its conversion into oxysterols via the action of several cholesterol hydroxylases, including the CYP27A1 enzyme [3][4].The aim of the present study is to determine the mechanisms underlying cholesterol elimination in the visual system as well as neuron-glia interactions. The Drosophila genetic model has been chosen for its efficiency in exploring neuronal signaling pathways. We have started to screen the down-expression of a series of CYP27A1 orthologs using RNA interference in specific neurons or glial cells in the visual system. We first used the neuron specific driver, gmr-Gal4, to inactivate CYP27A1 orthologs in the eye. In parallel, we started to perform immunostaining experiments to determine whether downregulation of CYP27A1 orthologs can induce neurodegeneration in the eye during aging. Cholesterol accumulation in fly heads will also be evaluated using gas/liquid chromatography to determine the role of CYP27A1 orthologs in cholesterol metabolism in Drosophila.A better understanding of the role of retinal cells in cholesterol homeostasis should help in the development of effective retinal degeneration therapies.;1;11h38;11h51;Session 2;Neurobiologie;Neurobiology;;
Montillot;Charlotte;Neuroanatomical studies identify Vacuolar Protein Sorting 13 homolog B as an important regulator of brain architecture and hippocampal formation;Oral;Vacuolar Protein Sorting 13 homolog B (VPS13B) is a highly conserved protein through evolution, but its function is not well understood yet. Human mutations in VPS13B cause Cohen Syndrome, a rare recessive developmental disease characterized by intellectual disability, acquired microcephaly and hypotonia. Mouse Vps13b is highly expressed across several brain structures including the hippocampus and the cortex. Using a knockout mouse model approach, we set out to identify the role of VPS13B in the brain. We first showed that homozygous mutant mice of Vps13b are sub-viable, half dying progressively during the first week of life. The survivor homozygous mutant mice exhibit growth delay and microcephaly (-27% for weight and -20% for microcephaly in adult male mice). Using a systematic neuroanatomical study at multiple ages (embryonic E18.5 and postnatal 5, 7, 18 and 33 weeks), we then found severe neuroanatomical changes appearing within the first few weeks after birth in homozygous mutant mice when compared to matched controls. The hippocampus is the most affected brain region with a reduction of 34% of the size of the dentate gyrus. Finally, we performed a battery of behavioral tests and showed hyperactivity, hypotonia and altered memory but enhanced sociability and resilience to anxiety and depression in Vps13b homozygous mutant mice. It is noteworthy that heterozygous mutant mice did not show any apparent phenotype. Together, these findings indicate a highly specific role of VPS13B in the regulation of brain structure and an association with previously unreported features of Cohen Syndrome.;1;11h54;12h09;Session 2;Neurobiologie;Neurobiology;;
Tolassy;Vincent;Pheromonal ?Proust's madeleine? in Drosophila melanogaster: cVA imprinting impact on adult neural and behavioral development;Oral;Sensory imprinting is defined as the presentation of a stimulus during a restrained period of the early development of an individual (i.e. critical period) having everlasting consequences on its behaviour at a later stage (Hess, 1964).Recently, a new form of imprinting to a male pheromone, cis-Vaccenyl Acetate (cVA), has been discovered in Drosophila melanogaster (Everaerts et al., 2018). The imprinting takes place by the transmission of the pheromone from males to females during mating. Females will then simultaneously transfer eggs and cVA onto their laying substrate, obliging the larvae to develop in contact with the pheromone during their embryonic development and when emerging from the eggs.When perceived with other pheromonal compounds (cuticular hydrocarbons - CHCs), cVA mediates several sexual and subsocial behavior in a sex-specific manner including aggregation over food sources. Lasts results showed indeed that females tend to be more attracted than males by food enriched with cVA and males or females CHCs (Cazal�-Debat et al., 2019).However, apart from the work describing this pheromonal imprinting to cVA (i.e. Everaerts et al., 2018), no study considered the imprinting status of individuals. By naturally and experimentally manipulating the pre-imaginal exposure of tested Drosophila to cVA, my PhD project mainly consisted in studying (i) long-range attraction of imprinted individuals towards food labelled by conspecifics? CHCs supplemented with cVA and (ii) the peripheral antennal detection of cVA in such imprinted individuals.;1;12h12;12h27;Session 2;Neurobiologie;Neurobiology;;
Delescluse;Julie;Role of MINIDISCS, an amino-acid transporter, on glutamatergic activity in Drosophila melanogaster mushroom bodies, and its impact on behaviour;Oral;The Solute Carrier Family 7 (SLC7A) is a heterodimeric amino acid transporter family which plays a crucial role in cell and tissue physiology and metabolism in mammals. It was been characterized as a key factor in some human cancers.Five potential SLC7A orthologs -minidiscs, genderblind, JhI-21, sobremesa and CG1607- have been identified in Drosophila.To unravel the role of SLC7A transporters in the amino acid signalling in the adult central nervous system (CNS) we focused on MINIDISCS (MND) transporter.MND is expressed in various cells in the CNS. We already highlighted the role of MND in IPCs as a crucial factor for DILP secretion and sugar metabolism.Here we show that MND is also expressed in some neurons forming the ?/? and ? lobes of the mushroom bodies (MB). Downexpression of Mnd in these neurons impairs the role of various amino-acids on MB activity using live calcium imaging. Surprisingly, we found that MND is an important glutamatergic actor in these neurons. We investigated the genetic coexpression of MND with various glutamatergic receptors, and we found that ionotropic (NMDAR, KAINATE, GLUCL?) and metabotropic (dmGLUR) receptors are co-expressed in the MB. We also found that downstream effectors of MND, such as Glutamate Deshydrogenase (GDH) and TOR are also involved in glutamatergic response in these kenyon cells.The mushroom body is a neuronal structure known to be involved in learning and memory, and also in social behaviour like courtship or aggression. We investigate the potential role of MND in aggressive behaviour.These results strongly support a key role played by MND in glutamatergic activity control in Drosophila melanogaster. This information opens fascinating new field of investigations, which could allow a better understanding of how nutrients and simple molecules, such as glutamate, can influence neuronal activity and could impact behaviour.;1;12h30;12h45;Session 2;Neurobiologie;Neurobiology;;
Ghassani;Aya;Activity of murepavadin and resistance mechanisms in cystic fibrosis Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains;Oral;Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen well-known in cystic fibrosis patients (CF). Unfortunately, its high capacity to adapt to the pulmonary environment (biofilm formation) and to develop several antibiotic resistance mechanisms limits the therapeutic options to eradicate it, particularly in chronically-colonized CF patients. Thus, the development of new molecules anti-Pseudomonas is urgent. Murepavadin (POL7080) is a new peptidomimetic derived from protegrin, currently in phase 3-clinical trials, which has demonstrated promising results in vitro against P. aeruginosa. It interacts with the outer membrane protein LptD resulting in the accumulation of lipopolysaccharides in the periplasmic space and cell death. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of murepavadin on a collection of 230 clinical CF strains isolated from 12 French hospitals including colistin resistant strains and to identify the mechanisms contributing to murepavadin resistance. The MIC50 and MIC90 of the collection were 0.125 and 4 ?g/ml, respectively. Interestingly, 21 strains exhibited MIC values for murepavadin higher than 8 ?g/ml compared to the wild type strain PAO1 (0.06 ?g/ml). Comparison of the genomes of several pairs of strains (susceptible/resistant to murepavadin) isolated from the same patient (n=13) revealed mutations in genes involved in LPS biosynthesis including lpxl1 and in two-component systems such as the pmrB gene, previously described for its role in AMP resistance. The allelic replacement of lpxl1 or pmrB genes in the reference strain PAO1 by the respective mutated genes, reduced the susceptibility of the PAO1 strain to murepavadin. In all, this study shows a good activity of murepavadin in the CF clinical strains of P. aeruginosa. But, although P. aeruginosa is not yet exposed to murepavadin (commercially-unavailable), strains are already resistant to this new molecule.;1;11h20;11h35;Session 2;Pneumologie et Cardiologie;Pulmonology and Cardiology;;
Tanguy;Julie;NCI-41356, a promising small inhibitor of HSPB5 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?;Oral;Introduction: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive and lethal disease of unknown aetiology. In France, it ranks among the most frequent interstitial pathologies and affects 6 out of 8 people per 100,000 each year. IPF is characterized by dysregulated healing mechanisms that leads to the accumulation of large amounts of collagen in the lung tissue that disrupts the alveolar architecture. Nintedanib and Pirfenidone are the only currently available treatments even though they are only able to slow down the disease without being curative. In this context, inhibiting HSPB5, a low molecular weight heat shock protein known to be involved in the development of fibrosis, could constitute a potential therapeutic target. Our aim consists to explore how NCI-41356 (a chemical inhibitor of HSPB5) can limit the development of pulmonary fibrosis.Methods: In vivo, fibrosis was assessed in mice injected intratracheally (i.t.) with Bleomycin (BLM) and treated with NaCl or NCI-41356 (3 times i.t. or 3 times a week i.v.). Fibrosis was evaluated by collagen quantification (Sircol, Sirius Red staining), Immunofluorescence, TGF? gene expression (RNAscope). In vitro, TGF-?1 signaling was evaluated in epithelial cells treated by TGF-?1 with or without NCI-41356 (Western Blot, Immunofluorescence, Proximity ligation assay). In parallel, we explored the specific inhibitory properties of NCI41356 on HSPB5/SMAD4 interaction (Nanotemper).Results: In vivo, NCI-41356 reduced the accumulation of collagen, the expression of TGF-?1 and several pro-fibrotic markers (PAI-1, ?-SMA). In vitro, NCI-41356 decreased the interaction between HSPB5 and SMAD4 explaining NCI-41356 anti-fibrotic properties.Conclusion: In this study, we determined that inhibition of HSPB5/SMAD4 could limit IPF in mice. NCI-41356 modulates SMAD4 nuclear translocation thus limiting TGF-?1 signaling and synthesis of collagen and pro-fibrotic markers. Further investigations with human fibrotic lung tissues are needed to determine if these results can be transposed in human.;1;11h38;11h51;Session 2;Pneumologie et Cardiologie;Pulmonology and Cardiology;;
Loriod;Sabrina;Lipid metabolism as a therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis;Oral;Introduction: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease of the lung. The therapeutic option for patients with IPF is limited as only two drugs approved, which cannot reverse of stop the progression of the disease. The current working model of IPF patho-biology is based on impaired cellular communication between epithelial cells and fibroblastic cells, the latter being responsible for the collagen accumulation characterizing fibrosis. In this context, we are working on Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), a system of intercellular communication. EVs are lipid vesicles and accumulate in the lung of patients with IPF and promote fibrosis mechanisms.Methods: Lipid metabolism has been investigated using publicly available transcriptomic data and in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin. We have established the lipidome of EVs isolated from mice with lung fibrosis or controls. Therapeutic efficacy and prognostic potential of the inhibition of lipid metabolism have been tested in fibroblasts in vitro and in animal model of lung fibrosis.Results: Lipid metabolism was dysregulated in patients with IPF and in mice with pulmonary fibrosis compared to respective controls. The increase of enzyme involved in lipid metabolism correlated with disease progression and with EV secretion within the lung. EVs exhibited a specific lipid signature during pulmonary fibrosis. The inhibition of phospholipid metabolism decreased fibroblast activation and reduced bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Further, the use of a radioactive phospholipid precursor was able to detect fibrosis accumulation.Conclusion: Lipid metabolism increases during pulmonary fibrosis and correlates with disease progression and the secretion of EVs. The lipids identified in EVs during fibrosis can serve as a double-edge target for IPF with therapeutic and diagnostic properties.;1;11h54;12h09;Session 2;Pneumologie et Cardiologie;Pulmonology and Cardiology;;
Rigal;Eve;Long-term impact of postnatal overfeeding on cardio-metabolism risk and on sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo;Oral;Nutritional disturbances during the postnatal period may be responsible for a predisposition, or ?programming?, to increased cardio-metabolic risk and to an alteration of left ventricular contractility in adulthood. However, these data have mainly obtained in young male mice, but less is known for older animals.Our aim was to evaluate the impact of PostNatal OverFeeding (PNOF) on cardiac function, on cardiac sensitivity to IschemiaReperfusion (I-R) injury in vivo and on glucose metabolism in young (4 months), adult (6 months) and old (12 months) male mice.PNOF was induced by the reduction of litter size of C57/BL6 mice immediately after birth: Normally-Fed group (NF) was composed of 9 male pups/mother and OverFed group (OF) of 3 pups/mother. Echocardiography and blood sugar tests have been performed at all ages. An in vivo I-R injury was induced by the ligation of the anterior interventricular artery for 45 minutes followed by 24 h of reperfusion.PNOF induced an early and permanent increase in body weight in OF group, independently of mice?s age. The echocardiographic measurements showed an alteration of contractile function from 6 months and up to 12 months as evidenced by a decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction. These cardiac alterations were associated with glucose metabolism imbalance: OF males presented glucose intolerance and insulin resistance at all ages. To finish, PNOF induced a significant increase of infarct size at all ages after cardiac surgery.Nutritional programming through short-term PNOF induced an early alteration of glucose metabolism and was associated with a constant higher susceptibility to myocardial I-R injury in vivo. Moreover, mice which were submitted to PNOF developed altered cardiac contractility at 6 months and up to 12 months. The cellular and biochemical mechanism need further exploration but could involve alterations in cardiomyocyte pathways, and/or modification of global inflammatory status.;1;12h12;12h27;Session 2;Pneumologie et Cardiologie;Pulmonology and Cardiology;;
Josse;Marie;Evaluation of left ventricular function following myocardial infarction in adult postnatally overfed mice;Oral;Introduction: Perinatal environment, such as nutritional state, is of major importance for short- and long-term cardio metabolic status. Postnatal overfeeding (PNOF) induced in rodents by litter size reduction at birth reproduces the effects of childhood overnutrition and was shown to affect cardiovascular function and pathologies. We aimed to follow the evolution of cardiac function for 60 days after myocardial infarction (MI) in control and PNOF mice.Method: C57BL/6 male mice were raised in litter adjusted to 9 or 3 pups for control and PNOF group respectively. After weaning, both groups had access to standard diet. At 4 months, they were subjected to a permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) to induce MI or sham surgery. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography at baseline, 7, 28, 45 and 60 days after surgery. 60d post-surgery, the left ventricle (LV) was harvested for bio-molecular analyzes.Results: At basal state, no difference of cardiac function was observed between the 4 groups. In both groups subjected to LAD ligation, the ejection fraction was significantly decreased 7d post-surgery while the systolic/diastolic LV area was significantly increased, they both remained impaired until 60d. An increase of cardiac troponin I level was observed 24h post-surgery. However, despite some tendencies, no differences neither in LV contractile function nor in infarct size were noticed between the two groups, due to a small number of individuals per group.Conclusion: As demonstrated by the decreased LV contractility and dilation, the two groups of mice subjected to MI developed heart failure, however, no differences between the control and PNOF groups were observed by now. Further experiments will be done to enhance significance of these results and to assess the cardiac expression of genes and proteins involved in heart failure such as the b-Myosin Heavy Chain or the Atrial Natriuretic Peptide.;1;12h30;12h45;Session 2;Pneumologie et Cardiologie;Pulmonology and Cardiology;;
Eicher;Camille;Directed evolution of Oenococcus oeni to improve acido-tolerance reveals fixed beneficial mutations in the citrate locus;Oral;Oenococcus oeni is a Lactic Acid Bacteria responsible for the malolactic fermentation converting malic acid into lactic acid and carbon dioxide in wines. This second fermentation remains essential for the deacidification, the introduction of aromatic notes and the improvement of microbial stability in many wines. Nevertheless, wine represents a harsh environment for microbial growth due to the lack of nutrients, low pH, high ethanol amounts and the presence of sulfites. Therefore, a better understanding of the cellular response mechanisms to these abiotic stresses is needed in order to improve bacterial tolerance. The directed evolution approach was used to identify target genes which are likely to be involved in acid-tolerance.For this purpose, the Oenococcus oeni ATCC-BAA-1163 strain was propagated in a medium with a progressive pH decrease (from 5.3 to 2.9). This experiment was carried out continuously for 20 months, representing 550 successive generations. The evolved populations obtained underwent fixed mutations located in five genes, including the mae gene which is part of the citrate locus. It appears that these evolved populations, deficient in the mae gene, consume citrate much more slowly than the ancestral strain. Indeed, a transcriptomic analysis showed that the genes related to citrate metabolism are strongly downregulated in the evolved populations. The citrate consumption altered rate resulting from these mutations seems to confer to the bacteria a better resistance under low pH conditions. Indeed, while the addition of citrate in the medium affects the growth of the ancestral population at pH lower than 3.2, there is no change in growth for the evolved populations.;1;16h50;11h35;Session 2;Microbiologie;Microbiology;;
Bellanger;Tiffany;Can we predict the molecular lipochaperon activity of bacterial small heat shock proteins?;Oral;The production of small heat shock protein (sHSP) is one of the main stress response strategies developed by bacteria. All sHSPs have the common characteristic to act as molecular chaperone. Some of them have, in addition, the particularity to exert a lipochaperon role by interacting with membrane lipids to maintain an optimal membrane fluidity. Although crucial for the survival of the cells, this lipochaperon activity in sHSPs remains poorly described in the literature. Indeed, the experimental methods allowing its study to remain laborious and require the use of fluorescent molecular probes, protein purification and the production of model membranes. Despite a strong heterogeneity of sequences, the presence of highly conserved domains could play a key role in the establishment of these activities.Bioinformatics analysis of primary sequences from different sHsp described or not for their lipochaperon activity was performed to identify the conserved domains. A directed mutagenesis strategy was then developed in sHsp Lo18 of the lactic acid bacterium O. oeni, a model organism for the stress response. The impact of these mutations on sHsp-membrane lipid interaction and on the maintenance of membrane fluidity was measured by immunolabeling and spectrofluorimetry. The first data suggest the importance of these domains in the structure of Lo18 and consequently in its lipochaperone function.This work could provide a predictive tool on the primary structure-function relationship of sHSPs.;1;11h38;11h51;Session 2;Microbiologie;Microbiology;;
Huet;Sarah;Experimental community coalescence sheds light on microbial interactions in soil and restores impaired functions;Oral;While microbes can interact with each other in numerous ways, little is known about the contribution of these interactions to microbial community assembly. Here, we manipulated soil microbial communities to assess the importance of interactions between microorganisms. For this purpose, we first subjected a soil microbial community to 18 different removal treatments before reinoculation in its native, but sterilized, soil. Shifts in microbial communities were assessed by 16S rRNA MiSeq sequencing and soil functions were investigated using proxies for C and N cycling. We found that 47% of the dominant OTUs across removal treatments exhibited increased relative fitness after 45 days of incubation. To test the hypothesis that depletion of competitors by the removal treatments was behind the increased relative fitness, we then used a coalescence approach by mixing the depleted and control communities and postulated that it would re-establish the initial interactions. The coalescence approach not only revealed the importance of density-dependent interactions in microbial community assembly but also allowed to restore partly or fully community diversity and soil functions. We found that shifts in both inorganic nitrogen pools and soil pH after microbial community manipulation were related to the proportion of ammoniaoxidizing bacteria. Our work provides new insights into the understanding of the importance of microbial interactions in soil. Our top-down approach combining removal and coalescence manipulation also allowed linking community structure and ecosystem functions. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of manipulating microbial communities for restoration of soil ecosystems.;1;11h54;12h09;Session 2;Microbiologie;Microbiology;;
Aruei;Enisa;The role of Odorant-Binding Proteins in nutrition under the control of microbiota;Oral;"Most studies have revealed the impact of gut microbiota on our brain, our behavior and on various pathologies. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster like an animal model to study the hostmicrobiota interactions under different conditions of nutrition. While gut microbes promote amino acids uptake during denutrition, specific microbes can enhance the production of odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) (Benoit et al., 2017; Yamada et al., 2015). OBPs produced in sensillar lymph are a family of soluble carrier proteins involved in chemoreception. They play an essential role in the perception of odorants, such as pheromones and host chemicals. Initially described for their carrier role in olfactory appendages, more recently OBPs were attributed new physiological?sometimes unexpected?roles. The project of my PhD thesis consists to further decipher the role of OBPs in the digestive system and to determine the impact of microbes on OBP expression. To carry out this project, we analysed by quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) the expression profiles of four OBPs in different tissues (thorax, head, and intestine in male, virgin female, and mated female) after 2h and 16h fasting. The results showed that two of these four OBPs are expressed in the male intestine. Then, we focused on the expression of one of these OBPs in the digestive system which showed an important expression in the male hindgut. The future use of a mutant will allow us to better understand the role of this OBP on chemically-induced behaviors. Other approaches including competitive fluorescence binding assay will allow us to determine its binding properties. The global impact of microbiota will be studied by measured of OBP quantitative expression in microbiotacontrolled culture. This work will provide new insights into the roles of OBPs in nutrition under the control of microbiota and help to better understand the host-microbiota interactions in the peripheral and digestive systems.";1;12h12;12h27;Session 2;Microbiologie;Microbiology;;
Kiseleva;Anna;The selective influence of maternal odor on demanding face categorization in the infant brain;Oral;The presence of the mother?s body odor facilitates rapid (i.e., at a glance) visual face categorization (i.e., discrimination of faces from many other objects and generalization of this discrimination across variable individual faces) in 4 month-old infants in the form of an enhanced face-selective electroencephalographic (EEG) response over right occipito-temporal brain regions. We address here whether such intersensory influence is particularly effective when rapid face categorization is demanding for the infant brain. We recorded the scalp EEG in 2 groups of 4-month-olds (N = 21 each) while they were watching streams of 6 pictures per second (6 Hz) with faces inserted every 6th picture to tag a face-selective response at 1 Hz in the EEG spectrum. In group 1, we used natural images with objects and faces depicted with variable poses and viewpoints in front of their backgrounds, as in previous studies. In group 2, the images were edited to remove the background, and objects and faces were always depicted from a full-front view to make rapid categorization less demanding. During visual stimulation, infants were alternatively exposed to a T-shirt imbued with their mother?s body odor (i.e., worn by the mother) or to an unworn, control T-shirt. For both groups, we found an occipito-temporal face-selective neural response, but with a larger amplitude for the edited images, reflecting more efficient categorization. Importantly, the mother?s odor enhances the face-selective response for natural but not for edited images, suggesting that maternal odor shapes rapid face categorization only when it is demanding for the 4-month-old visual system. Overall, these results support the view that the development of visual categorization relies on multisensory cues when unisensory inputs are not fully effective in triggering optimal categorization.;1;16h50;16h05;Session 3;Cognition et Apprentissage;Cognition and Learning;;
Stansbury;Eleanor;How stimuli availability effects novel noun generalization in a free-choice design;Oral;A common result in novel word generalization is that comparison settings (i.e., several stimuli introduced simultaneously) favor conceptualization and generalization. Most generalization studies on comparison have been done with forced-choice designs. In the aim to make the task more ecological, we investigated which type of items four-, five- and six-year-old children would choose as referents in a free-choice novel noun generalization task.We manipulated the generalization items availability at test (i.e., generalization stimuli introduced sequentially or simultaneously). We also manipulated the semantic distance between items. Using signal detection theory as an interpreting framework, results showed that a simultaneous presentation of generalization items improves children?s sensitivity and helps them use a neutral strategy to generalize. Conceptual distance at learning also effects generalization performance.Results are discussed in terms of the constraints that both types of presentation bring into the task and tend to suggest that comparison between learning items is not the only process that helps us build our representation of objects of our environment.;1;16h08;16h23;Session 3;Cognition et Apprentissage;Cognition and Learning;;
Lagarrigue;Yannick;Do offline vs. online learning reflect implicit vs. explicit learning strategies? The contribution of manipulation of RSI in a serial reaction time task;Oral;One of the most popular tasks to investigate motor sequence learning in adults and children is the serial reaction time task (SRTT). This is a multiple-choice reaction time (RT) task that consists of a single learning session of several blocks of practice interspersed with short breaks. In each block, participants are required to press a button corresponding to the location of a visual stimulus. The visual stimuli are presented in a fixed order that is unknown to participants. It has been recently suggested that online learning, which is improvement in performance within the blocks of practice, would be driven by explicit (declarative) knowledge of the fixed sequence. Conversely, offline learning, which is improvement between the blocks of practice, would be driven by implicit learning of the sequence.The present study investigated the effect of response-stimulus interval (RSI, 0, 250, or 750 ms), a factor known to influence the acquisition of explicit knowledge, on online and offline sequence learning in adults and ten-year-old children. In comparison to the standard 250-ms RSI, we expected greater offline learning in 0-ms RSI condition and greater online learning with 750-ms RSI.Our results fit with previous findings showing less offline learning and more online learning in adults than in children. Moreover, our data suggest that learning patterns are affected by RSI. Indeed, there was more offline learning and less online learning in the 0-ms RSI condition compared to the standard 250-ms RSI. However, contrary to our expectations, lengthening the RSI did not increase online learning. Overall, these data partly support the hypothesis that offline learning and online learning patterns are associated with implicit and explicit learning strategies respectively.;1;16h26;16h41;Session 3;Cognition et Apprentissage;Cognition and Learning;;
Magnier;Logan;Influence of own-body odor on face detection: A psychophysical approach in adults;Oral;Familiar faces elicit more robust representations than non-familiar faces, leading to a general advantage for familiar faces. Familiar faces are detected and categorized faster and are more accurately recognized .Moreover, a growing number of findings highlight that human body odors influence social information processing, especially when it comes to faces .For example, own-body odor speeds up the visual recognition of self-face over another face .However, the mechanisms underlying these olfacto-visual influences remain unclear. Thus, the study examined 1) whether own-body odor modulated face detection mechanisms, and 2) whether the potential facilitation effect of own-body odor is limited to the processing of self-face or extends to unfamiliar faces.Thirty-two participants (27 females, Mean Age = 21.6 years, SD = 3.9 years) were exposed to a screen presenting a series of grids (for 16 milliseconds) containing either a target face (i.e., self- or unfamiliar) among 48 distractors objects or distractors only, while being exposed to their own body odor or to a neutral odor.The detection of both own and unknown faces among the distractors increased following exposure to own odor compared to a neutral odor (F(1,28) = 5.939, p<.05, ?�p = .175). This suggests a general effect of self-odor on face perception, reminiscent of findings showing that maternal body odor enhances response to faces compared to objects in newborns aged 4 months. Moreover, correct rejections (i.e., correct reporting that no face was in the grid) resulted in longer reaction times in the own-odor condition, but only in the self-face condition (F(1,28) = 4.452, p<.05, ?�p = .137). Thus, top-down processes might operate, self-odor increasing participants? expectation to see their own face. Further studies should assess the effect of non familiar body odors to test these interpretations.;1;16h44;16h59;Session 3;Cognition et Apprentissage;Cognition and Learning;;
Masson;Aymeric;Mutli-omics exploration of transcriptional defects related to genome structural variations in rare developmental diseases;Oral;The biological interpretation of complex chromosomal rearrangements for the diagnosis of rare diseases represents a major challenge in the current genomic era. Although conventional genome exploratory studies successfully determine more than half of the molecular causes, they are sometimes not sufficient to accurately reveal the functional impact of complex variations on gene expression. The size of the rearrangement as well as the multiple breakpoints disrupt the spatial conformation of genomic regions essential for regulating transcription. Indeed, topologically associated domains (TAD) are hubs of chromatin interactions between genetic regulators and their target genes that modulate transcriptional activity. It is well known that human pathology can originate from the disruption of TADs, rewiring or interrupting the communications between enhancers and promoters, for example. In this context, genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) brings many advantages: TADs analysis, and identification of genomic variations as well as their modeling with their breakpoints. In addition, Hi-C methodology provides functional information about missing and/or ectopic contacts between genes and their regulatory elements responsible for transcriptional defects. The Hi-C technique is currently used in the GAD laboratory on a cohort of patients with developmental abnormalities who present chromosomal rearrangements that may reshape the structure of TADs. This molecular approach, performed on patient-derived cell lines and combined with other omics techniques such as optical mapping, long read sequencing, RNA sequencing and other epigenomic studies will allow the identification of new pathological mechanisms that will then be validated in cellular or mouse models.;1;9h30;16h05;Session 3;Maladies et G�n�tique;Diseases and Genetics;;
Lallemand;Severine;Study of the complete mitochondrial genome of Echinococcus multilocularis from french alveolar echinococcosis patients;Oral;"Echinococcus multilocularis (Em) is the agent responsible for Alveolar Echinococcosis (AE), a rare but severe disease whose incidence is steadily increasing in France. The current use of genotypic markers (mitochondrial gene parts, microsatellite markers) is essential but does not allow sufficient discrimination to study the temporal and spatial spread of the parasite. The aim of this study was (I) to describe a new method of Em complete mitogenome genotyping; (II) to describe the genetic diversity in a collection of Em samples from French AE patients; (III) to compare this method with those previously used.Seven pairs of primers were designed and three PCR (1 uniplex and 3 multiplex) were developed to amplify the entire mitochondrial genome of Em (13,738 bp). Sequencing was performed by Next Generation Sequencing (Illumina method). Variant calling was made after alignment with the reference sequence of Nakao et al (GenBank Acc No: AB018440.2). Haplotypes were determined after selecting an internal reference. The nucleotide diversity was compared to that determined from the cob, cox1 and nad2 gene sequences.Thirty-one sequences were analyzed. One of them showed strong identity (99.98%) with Asian genotypes. The other mitogenomes were classified into 13 haplotypes, demonstrating greater nucleotide and haplotypic diversity than for the cob, cox1 and nad2 gene sequence set.The Fst value (amount of genetic variance) between individuals living in the endemic area and outside was high (0.222; p = 0.002) in accordance with the hypothesis of expansion within a mainland island system as previously described, but with possible genetic differentiation. Two hypervariable regions have been identified in the non-coding regions of the Em mitochondrial genome and should provide an easier and more efficient method to study the genetic diversity of Em.";1;16h08;16h23;Session 3;Maladies et G�n�tique;Diseases and Genetics;;
Sauter;Camille;PRMT2: an anti-inflammatory epigenetic factor involved in acute myeloid leukemia aggressiveness;Oral;Protein Arginine Methyltransferases (PRMTs) are epigenetic factors involved in several cellular processes and overexpression of the two major PRMTs have been previously identified in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients. Among the nine members of this protein family, PRMT2 is overexpressed in glioblastoma and is responsible for the H3R8me2a epigenetic mark leading to transcription activation. PRMT2 has also a role in the inflammatory pathway but it is not clearly established. Moreover, it is well known that severe chronic inflammation can contribute to the development of cancers. Exacerbated inflammatory responses and aberrant myeloproliferation are thus interconnected. We are investigating the role of PRMT2 in AML and its precise role in the inflammatory processes. We used a Prmt2 knockout mouse model (Prmt2KO) and the Leucegene AML patient cohort (IRIC, Montr�al, QC, Canada). We also generated a knockout human AML HL-60 cell line using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Prmt2KO mice do not exhibit difference in hematopoiesis in comparison with wild type mice. However, we observed that Prmt2KO bone marrow-derived macrophages are more sensitive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, suggesting a role of PRMT2 as a negative regulator of the inflammatory processes. Analysis of datasets from a cohort of 371 AML patients reveals that patients with a lower PRMT2 expression display a worse survival rate. In addition, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of this cohort show that PRMT2 is involved in the inflammatory response signaling pathway. We also show that PRMT2 KO cells exhibit higher levels of phosphorylated STAT3 protein compared to wild type cells after LPS stimulation. Taken together, our data suggest that PRMT2 may have an anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, AML patients harboring a low PRMT2 expression could induce a higher inflammatory phenotype, thus resulting to worse overall survival. PRMT2 could be involved in the STAT3 signaling pathway by preventing its activation leading to increased inflammation.;1;16h26;16h41;Session 3;Maladies et G�n�tique;Diseases and Genetics;;
Savary;Stephane;Disruption of peroxisomal beta-oxidation in microglia alters the survival and morphology of differentiated neurons, an insight to the pathophysiology of X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy;Oral;Peroxisomal ABC transporters (ABCD1 and ABCD2) transport acyl-CoA esters of very longchain fatty acids (VLCFA) into the peroxisome for their ?-oxidation. X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease and the most common peroxisomal disorder, is associated with mutations in the ABCD1 gene. By CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in murine BV-2 microglial cells, we have generated four new genotypes of BV-2 cells by inactivating Abcd1 gene, its closest homologue Abcd2, as well as the Acox1 gene that controls the first step of peroxisomal ?-oxidation. These cells serve as cellular models of X-ALD and exhibit lipid abnormalities such as VLCFA and cholesterol accumulations.The generated knockout BV-2 cells had been characterized at the RNA level through transcriptomic analysis as well as at the protein level thus revealing a huge similarity with the disease associated microglia (DAM) signature which is observed in common neurodegenerative diseases. The knockout cells show induced secretion of common pathological signature proteins as well as proinflammatory cytokines. In order to functionally characterize this cellular model, we implemented co-culture system of BV-2 cells with differentiated neurons (mHypoA cell line). We also examined the impact of the secretions of the BV-2 cells on mHypoA through conditioned medium system. The neurons showed decreased survival and/or growth and less neurite extensions when incubated with the knockout cells or with their secretions. The mechanisms underlying the decreased number of neurons and the alteration of their morphology and functioning are currently under investigation.Our results could be used to uncover the cellular origin and the pathogenesis of X-ALD and might consequently help in unraveling treatment alternatives.;1;16h44;16h59;Session 3;Maladies et G�n�tique;Diseases and Genetics;;
Dubois;Eline;Involvement of gene PA3722 in the resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to toxic compounds;Oral;Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen bacterium responsible for severe pulmonary infections among Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. Due to its multiple resistance mechanisms, about 40% of French CF patients use essential oils (EOs) simultaneously to antibiotics in order to improve their efficacity. However, selection of EOs resistant bacteria is possible since we obtained mutants resistant to cinnamaldehyde (CNA), the main compound from cinnamon EO. Whole genome sequencing showed that most of them had mutations in repressor gene nalC leading to the overproduction of MexAB-OprM, an efflux pump known to extrude �-lactams antibiotics outside the cell. One nalC mutant, having an insertion shifting the stop codon in the downstream gene PA3722, exhibited hypersusceptibility to aminoglycosides in addition to �-lactams resistance.In order to understand the role of PA3722 (which function is unknown) in the resistance phenotype, knock-out mutants inactivated in PA3722 and/or in nalC were obtained by homologous recombination from the reference strain P. aeruginosa PA14. The MICs (Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations) of antibiotics (�-lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides) were determined using the standard microdilution method. Gene expression of genes involved in MexAB-OprM regulation were carried out by RT-qPCR.Inactivation of PA3722 (PA14?PA3722) led to the same resistance profile than that of nalC: an increased resistance to �lactams (from 2- to 4-fold) and fluoroquinolones (x2), but no hypersusceptiblity to aminoglycosides. Surprisingly, the double mutation (PA14?PA3722?nalC) restored the susceptible phenotype to antibiotics and CNA. These results were confirmed by gene expression: PA14?PA3722 overexpressed all genes implicated in MexAB-OprM upregulation as a nalC mutant contrary to the double mutant expressing these genes at a basal level.In conclusion, EOs can select resistant mutants exhibiting cross-resistance to antibiotics. We demonstrated for the first time that PA3722 seems to be involved in mexAB-oprM regulation, even though the link with the well known repressor NalC needs to be clarified.;1;17h02;17h17;Session 3;Maladies et G�n�tique;Diseases and Genetics;;
Meunier;Lena;Sperm function and morphology in young and old North African houbara bustards;Oral;The North African houbara bustard is a threatened long lived bird part of large-scale conservation program aiming to restore wild populations throughout translocation of captive bred individuals produced using artificial insemination. Captive males can reproduce until advanced age, and their sperm quality is known to decline with ageing. The aim of this abstract is to describe sperm concentration, motility, viability, and morphology of ejaculates from young and old captive males. Semen samples were collected from February to May 2022, from 171 males: 72 old (14 to 20 years old) and 99 young (3 to 5 years old). Concentration and motility were assessed by computer assisted sperm analysis (SCA), and viability with association of SYbr green and propidiun iodide. Sperm morphology was classified under phase contrast microscopy and studied by electron microscopy. Ejaculate?s concentration was 194�102�106sptz/mL for young males and 159�91.4�106sptz/mL for old males. Viability was similar in young and old males (92.3�8.43% and 92.4�7.5% respectively), as well as percentage of motile sperm (86.5�10.4% for young and 85.5�11.5% for old) and percentage of morphologically normal sperm cell (67.3%�15.6 for young and 69.3%�13.7 for old).

Crosland;Agathe;"""Born with a silver spoon in the mouth has bad sides too"": experimentally increasing growth rate enhances individual quality but accelerates reproductive senescence in females of the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor";Oral;Senescence occurs because of the decline of the strength of selection with age, allowing late-life reduced performances not being counter selected. From there, several phenomena may explain late-life reduced performances, such as the accumulation of deleterious mutations, the expression of pleiotropic genes or the existence of resource trade-offs between early and late performances. This latter phenomenon is at the core of the disposable soma theory of ageing, which predicts that growth and early-life reproduction have costs that increase reproductive and actuarial senescence. Whereas the impact of the cost of early reproduction on reproductive and actuarial senescence has been extensively studied, that of the cost of growth remains overlooked and often inconclusive, possibly because of confounding effects associated with the procedures used to manipulate growth rate.Here, we investigated the cost of growth rate and its impact on reproductive senescence and longevity of females of the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor. For this purpose, we generated insects with contrasted growth rates by raising groups of them in conditions below, above and optimal relative humidity (RH: 55%, 85% and 70%, respectively) during the larval stage. The resulting adult females then bred, under the same optimal RH conditions, early in life, then later in life and were followed there until death.We found that larvae grown under the highest relative humidity exhibited the highest larval growth rate, thanks to both shorter growth duration and the achievement of heavier pupae mass. Adult females from this favorable growing condition lived longer, were more fecund early in life, but suffered from lower late-life reproductive investment. Our study shows that growth rate, which is highly dependent on the early-life environment, is an important factor modulating adult reproductive senescence, through the occurrence of early-late life trade-offs.;1;16h08;16h23;Session 3;Divers 1;Miscellaneous 1;;
Laroche;Noemie;Diet might alter large intestine parasitism in horses;Oral;"In horses, the research for alternative nutritional solutions to synthetic anthelmintics is a major concern. Sainfoin, a polyphenol-rich legume, has been shown to potentially disrupt equine parasitism. In parallel, it has been suggested that the dynamics of helminth infection might be altered when the intestinal ecosystem is disturbed. Thus ,the aim of this study was to determine whether parasitism was altered by a high-starch diet, and the addition of sainfoin to the ration.Twelve naturally infected geldings ?Trotteurs Fran�ais? were distributed into four homogeneous groups in terms of FEC (Fecal Egg Count), age, and bodyweight, and enrolled in a 4 periods � 4 diets Latin square design. Experimental periods lasted 21 days (D0 to D21) and were separated by 21 days wash-out periods. The four diets (iso-energy, iso-protein) consisted in either high-fiber diets (HF; 86% hay) or high-starch diets (HS; 46% hay/36% barley), to which were added either a mix of sunflower meal/hay pellets or sainfoin pellets (SF) at the same ingestion level (0.31%). Starch content represented 1.9g starch/kg BW/meal in HS diets. Parasite excretion was assessed from FEC counts on D0, D7, D14, and D21. Larval motility was scored on a 1-3 scale after coproculture at D21.A significant interaction Day*Diet was observed for FEC (P<0.001). At D0, FEC did not differ between groups. At D14, FEC were higher when horses were fed HS diet compared to the diets HF and HF+SF, and at D21 FEC were higher in horses receiving HS diet compared to three others. Larvae cultured from horses fed HS tended to be more mobile than from horses fed HS+SF (P=0.059). These results confirmed that diet composition can influence egg excretion and larval motility. The effect of sainfoin on parasitism was more pronounced in the high-starch diet, suggesting interactions between parasites, intestinal ecosystem, and the host.";1;16h26;16h41;Session 3;Divers 1;Miscellaneous 1;;
Suranyi;Thomas;Paleoclimatic reconstructions from fossil chironomids: methodological calibration and application to the study of northern maple stands in Quebec;Oral;Paleoenvironmental records represent a great opportunity to study climate change effects on vegetation over long time period. However, in temperate and boreal regions, climatic reconstructions are most often derived from pollen assemblages. Yet, it is not conceivable to study climate-vegetation relationships using the same proxy because it risks becoming circular reasoning. Consequently, other paleoclimatic proxies independent from vegetation should be used. This project aims first to develop the use of subfossil chironomids from lake sediment as summer temperature proxies in eastern Canada. The second objective of the project is to study the Holocene dynamics of northern maple stands (Acer saccharum and Acer rubrum) in the mixed-wood forest of Quebec. To obtain reliable climate reconstructions, the first need is to extend the temperature gradient covered by the existing dataset about modern chironomid assemblage distribution in lakes from Quebec. A newly merged dataset of lakes from Quebec, Labrador and New-England has been developed. The chironomid assemblages environment relationships were assessed using canonical analysis that confirmed the prominent role of summer temperatures on chironomid assemblages. Applying this new transfer function on stratigraphic data highlights that there is still a strong need to fill the remaining gap in the temperature gradient by adding new lakes from temperate domains. Another concern is the inference technique used, as several are available with good statistical performances. Using a multi-model approach may be a solution to this issue. Independent testing of each model from the comparison of reconstructed versus measured temperature is also planned to determine the best reconstruction method. Using a more complete training-set combined to the best reconstruction method will then enable to produce reliable summer temperature records for the mixed-wood forest of Quebec. Ultimately, these results along with other paleoenvironmental reconstructions will provide a better understanding of maple?s dynamics at boreal-temperate ecotone during the Holocene.;1;16h44;16h59;Session 3;Divers 1;Miscellaneous 1;;
Bracco Manzino;Lucia;Tango and quality of life in older people living in nursing homes;Oral;The health crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic has reinforced the necessity for improvement in the care of older people. This need is even more evident when it comes to people living in nursing homes, because entering an institution seems to be a factor in accelerating cognitive and functional decline. These factors cause a decrease in the quality of life (QoL). An increasing amount ofresearch shows the effectiveness of dance and music in relieving the symptoms of various diseases. However, these effects have sparsely been studied for older people living in nursing homes.Aims: to determine the effects of a tango dance intervention for older people living in nursing homes on the QoL.Methods: a multicenter, prospective, observational study with assessment at 0, 3 and 6 months. The duration of the tango dance intervention was 60 min and was carried out weekly over six months. QoL was assessed using the QoL-Alzheimer Disease scale.Results: In this forum we presentthe first results, which includes 8 facilities and 80 participants. Three months after the intervention we found a statistically significant improvement in the QoL-AD caregiver version (p=0,005) as well as in the global score (p=0,043), which weights the answers provided by the participant and by the caregiver.Conclusion: tango interventions seem to have a positive impact on participants' QoL, although additional studies, with a control group, are needed to demonstrate a direct link between the interventions and QoL.;1;17h02;17h17;Session 3;Divers 1;Miscellaneous 1;;
Barbaud;Alexandre;GW501516-mediated decrease of tetraspanin 15 inhibits N-cadherin cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 in bladder cancer;Oral;Therapeutic failures in cancer result from metastasis development, initiated by Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). A marker expressed during EMT is the adhesion molecule N-cadherin, which gives to tumor cells migratory and invasive capacities. A part of its pro-tumoral properties is from the function of its extracellular N-terminal fragment (NTF) and especially when it is cleaved by a Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10).A strategy to prevent the release of NTF is to inhibit ADAM10 activity. However, this enzyme is a molecular scissor cleaving numerous transmembrane substrates essential for the proper functioning of the cell. Thus, targeting ADAM10 directly could trigger several deleterious side effects. Recently, the fundamental role of the TetraspaninC8 transmembrane proteins (TspanC8: Tspan5, 10, 14, 15, 17, 33) has been highlighted in the selective cleavage of ADAM10 substrates. We confirmed the involvement of ADAM10 and Tspan15 for N-cadherin shedding in invasive bladder cancer cells. Indeed, when ADAM10 or Tspan15 expression is inhibited by a siRNA technology, the level of NTF was decreased in cell conditioned media. Others showed that the interaction between Tspan15 and ADAM10 favors selective cleavage of N-cadherin.We hypothesized that a pharmacological approach could be to inhibit Tspan15 and consequently the cleavage of N-cadherin by ADAM10. The GW501516 drug which is an agonist of PPAR?/?, a ligand-inducible transcription factor, could meet this need, since we previously showed that it triggers apoptosis.We demonstrated by western blotting that GW501516 decreased the level of NTF in cell conditioned media. Moreover, GW501516 did not act on ADAM10 but decreased Tspan15 at the mRNA and protein level. The molecular mechanisms of action of this molecule must be elucidated. However, by decreasing Tspan15 to block ADAM10-mediated cleavage of Ncadherin, GW501516 prevents release of NTF fragment, so probably its pro-tumoral effects.;2;9h;9h15;Session 1;Canc�rologie 2;Oncology 2;;
Perrichet;Anaes;Targeting interleukin-1? to improve chemoimmunotherapy in lung cancer;Oral;Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy to reactivate CD8 T-cell function has revolutionised the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Despite this effectiveness, most patients have intrinsic resistance to these checkpoint inhibitors. In order to find new avenues for combating resistance to immunotherapy, we investigated the involvement of interleukin-1? (IL-1?) in the response to chemoimmunotherapy. IL-1?, whose production can be induced by the NLRP3/caspase-1 inflammasome pathway, is a cytokine that can be either beneficial or deleterious, depending on the cancer models and cytotoxic agents used. To study the role of IL-1?, we used the LLC1 (Lewis Lung carcinoma cell line) model with an activating mutation of KRAS and overactivation of the MAP kinase pathway.Our in vitro and in vivo results show a beneficial effect of IL-1? in the response to cisplatin/pemetrexed/anti-PD-1 treatment in combination with a MEK inhibitor, trametinib. Indeed, the combination of treatments induces IL-1? production by cancer cells and this production is dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1. In this model, IL-1? acts in an autocrine manner on cancer cells and induces the production of CXCL10, a chemokine that enables the recruitment of CD8 T cells at the tumour site.Our results show that IL-1? is able to sensitise resistant tumour to chemoimmunotherapy.;2;9h18;9h33;Session 1;Canc�rologie 2;Oncology 2;;
Durand;Jules;Identification of novel partner proteins of EZH2 and KDM6B in epithelial to mesenchymal transition;Oral;Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a progressive and reversible mechanism through which cells with an epithelial phenotype switch to a mesenchymal one. During EMT, epithelial cells forming a cohesive tissue through cell-cell and cellmatrix junctions progressively dissociate from it and gain migratory properties. This mechanism has been linked to the formation of metastases in cancer. This switch in phenotype is the consequence of a wide reprogramming of gene expression leading to the downregulation of pro-epithelial genes (e.g. E-Cadherin, ZO-1) and upregulation of pro-mesenchymal genes (e.g. N-cadherin, Vimentin), both of which are tightly controlled by epigenetics. In particular, the methylation level of the Lysine 27 of the Histone H3 has been shown to vary significatively on the promoters of key genes during EMT. The methylation of H3K27 is regulated by the methylase EZH2 (Enhancer of Zest Homolog 2) and the demethylase KDM6B (Lysine Demethylase 6 B). Interestingly, despite having opposite catalytic activities, both enzymes induce EMT when overexpressed in cancerous cells. This could be due to the recruitment of these enzymes towards different sets of genes by partner proteins. To investigate this, we used Rapid Immunoprecipitation Mass spectroscopy of Endogenous proteins to identify proteins interacting with EZH2 or with KDM6B and associated with chromatin while using a TGF?/TNF? treatment to induce EMT. We identified, in A549 cells (non-small cell lung carcinoma), 93 putative partners of KDM6B and 77 putative partners of EZH2. Some of these partners are specifically associated with EZH2 or KDM6B following EMT induction. Some are transcription factors or co-regulators as well as proteins known to be involved in EMT. Investigating these proteins and the importance of their interaction with EZH2 and KDM6B during EMT could shed light on the role of EZH2 and KDM6B during EMT as well as unravel new targets for cancer therapies.;2;9h36;9h51;Session 1;Canc�rologie 2;Oncology 2;;
Kalfeist;Laura;Identification of novel CXCL10-inducing chemotherapy/targeted therapy combinations for immunotherapy sensitization of triple negative breast tumors;Oral;Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) is currently only treated with chemotherapy. There is no targeted therapy for this type of cancer and immunotherapy is ineffective. The combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is a strategy that has proven successful in other types of cancers such as lung cancer. Indeed, some chemotherapies are able to induce the phenomenon of immunogenic death and in particular the production of the chemokine CXCL10, capable of recruiting cytotoxic T lymphocytes to the tumor. However, the results in mTNBC are more quite conflicting. Indeed, a combination of paclitaxel and anti-PD-L1 in the IMPassion131 study showed no significant results. These results show that paclitaxel alone does not seem to be sufficient to activate the immune system and sensitize this cancer to immunotherapy. The aim of the research project was therefore to develop a combination therapy, inspired by the current clinical treatment regimen, capable of restoring the efficacy of anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy in triple negative breast cancer. In the first time, different doublets containing paclitaxel were used in the 4T1 model, characteristic of a triple-negative murine tumor, in vitro and in vivo in order to study their effects on the immune system and on the induction of CXCL10. These analyses allowed us to identify the paclitaxel/carboplatin doublet as a good candidate for combination. In a second step, a screening of 400 molecules targeting different signaling pathways was performed in vitro in combination with the selected doublet in order to determine potential CXCL10 inducers by flow cytometry. At the end of this screening, a synergistic combination will be selected and their immunological and therapeutic effects will be evaluated in vivo.;2;9h54;10h09;Session 1;Canc�rologie 2;Oncology 2;;
Baudu;Timothee;The Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) regulates GABARAPL1 mRNA during epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT);Oral;Autophagy is a conserved cellular catabolism pathway which maintains cellular homeostasis and is known to be deregulated in some pathologies, including cancer and metastasis spreading. The regulation of autophagy-related genes (ATG) is mainly studied at the protein level and few data are available regarding its post-transcriptional regulation. Some preliminary data have shown that the ATG8 family, comprising GABARAP and LC3 sub-families, may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism degrading premature termination codon (PTC)-harboring transcripts. The NMD has also been shown to target physiological transcripts which contain specific features (e.g. long 3?UTR, uORF, intron retention) and are usually involved in stress responses. It has also been described that the NMD is involved in tumour development, either by silenced tumour suppressor or enhanced oncogene expression.Our goal was therefore to study the regulation, at the mRNA level, of the ATG8 family by the NMD, and to identify molecular links between autophagy and NMD, two mechanisms involved in stress response and metastasis formation.Our data has shown that GABARAPL1, an ATG8 family member, is indeed degraded by the NMD. We also demonstrated that GABARAPL1 mRNA and protein levels are increased during EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition) and correlated to a decrease of UPF1, a key factor of NMD. Those data have also been confirmed by immunohistochemistry in vivo in a cohort of patients presenting non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs).Following these results, our work is now focused on the characterisation of the features which could lead to the targeting and degradation of GABARAPL1 by the NMD. Our recent preliminary results have already shown that this regulation involves the fixation of UPF1 and eIF4A3 proteins on the GABARAPL1 3?UTR, which suggests a new model of the stability of autophagy transcript by the NMD.;2;10h12;10h27;Session 1;Canc�rologie 2;Oncology 2;;
Aveline;Christopher;Differences in odor-induced taste enhancement between normal weight and obese populations;Oral;Some aromas have a taste dimension likely due to repeated experiences in food with tastes. These aromas can significantly enhance the related taste perception, this is called Odor-Induced Taste Enhancement (OITE). We tested whether OITE depended on weight status. We hypothesized that people with obesity (OB) would perceive a higher sweet taste enhancement than people with normal-weight (NW). We also tested salty taste enhancement without an oriented hypothesis. 43 NW and 38 OB took part in ranking tasks and evaluated OITE in 13 sweet and 4 salty solutions. The sweet base solutions were apple juice (Aj), cocoa (Coc) and water. The odorants were vanillin, ethyl-vanillin, french vanilla, two lychee odorants, and furaneol. The salty base solutions were a green-pea soup and water., and the odorants were smoky bacon smoked garlic odorants. Each ranking was performed with 4 solutions, 3 with an increasing concentration of salt/sugar, and the fourth contained the lower sugar/salt concentration and one odorant. Participants ranked the four solutions from lowest to highest sweetness/saltiness intensity. As a main result, OB group perceived more often OITE than NW. The maximum sweetness and saltiness enhancements were observed in OB with vanillin in apple juice and with bacon in salty water. Our results also demonstrated that the ranking task is efficient to assess OITE and to highlight differences between groups and solutions.;2;9h;9h15;Session 1;Nutrition et Go�t;Nutrition and Taste;;
Ullah;Hameed;Exogenous leptin upregulates fat taste sensitivity in leptin deficient obese mice;Oral;The incidence of obesity is on the rise throughout the world. Recent studies have successfully unveiled, the existence of a gustatory cue, i.e., taste for fat. This gustatory perception might result into overeating behavior. In this study, we used biochemical and behavioral approaches to explore the role of leptin (anorectic peptide) in fat taste perception. The two-bottle preference and licking tests were used to assess the fat taste sensitivity in mice. Confocal microscopy was used to demonstrate the colocalization of fat taste receptors (CD36 and GPR120) with leptin receptor in mice taste bud cells (TBCs). To explore the role of leptin in the oro-sensory perception of dietary fatty acids, we used RT-qPCR, calcium signaling, ELISA, membrane potential and western-blotting techniques. We conducted experiments on isolated TBC (exvivo studies) or on different mice models like genetically modified obese (ob/ob) or dietinduced obese (DIO) mice (in vivo studies) in order to explore the implication of leptin in the modulation of oro-sensory perception of dietary long-chain fatty acids. The in-vitro studies on cultured TBC show that leptin, released from these cells into the micro-environment of papillae of the tongue, exerts an inhibitory action on fat preference in wild type mice. Surprisingly, administration of exogenous leptin increased fat taste sensitivity in ob/ob mice, but DIO mice remain leptin resistant. Our results shows for the first time that leptin receptors co-expressed with fat taste receptors in TBC and may control fat eating behaviour via its local action, probably in an autocrine manner, in the taste papillae, and also via its peripheral action. Conclusively, we can state that exogenous administration of leptin upregulated the sensitivity of fatty acids which might decrease the intake of fat and ultimately reduce the body weight and obesity in the genetically modified ob/ob mice.;2;9h18;9h33;Session 1;Nutrition et Go�t;Nutrition and Taste;;
Haydar;Joulia;Chronic effect of the non nutritive sweetener Sucralose on hypothalamic glucose detection in rat;Oral;Introduction:The hypothalamus is involved in the detection of hyperglycemia, leading in particular to the vagal control of insulin secretion (autonomic nervous system). It has recently been shown that the consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) disrupts the mechanisms of blood glucose regulation and induces insulin resistance in the long term. Furthermore, it has been shown that there are extra-oral sweet taste receptors, especially in the hypothalamus . Our aim is to study the effect of chronic consumption of sucralose on hypothalamic glucose sensing and insulin release.Materials and Methods:5-weeks-old male Wistar rats were given access to 0.017% sucralose solution for 10 weeks (beyond the daily dose intake in mg/kg), while control group had access to water only. Weight, food and water intake, and blood glucose were monitored until the end of the period. After 10 weeks, glucose and insulin tolerance, body composition were measured. Finally, insulin release in response to hypothalamic hyperglycemia induced by intracarotid injection of glucose was measured. Blood was collected for measurements of plasma hormones.Results:Results showed that rats drinking sucralose for 10 weeks had higher blood glucose levels compared with the control group. They exhibited glucose intolerance, decreased lean mass and increased fat mass. Finally, sucralose-exposed rats showed decreased insulin secretion in response to hypothalamic hyperglycemia.Conclusion:Chronic sucralose exposure in rats leads to altered glucose metabolism and hypothalamic glucose sensing, lowering neural control of insulin secretion. In order to better understand the hypothalamic mechanisms involved, molecular signaling of sweet taste receptors in the hypothalamus will be studied on these animals.;2;9h36;9h51;Session 1;Nutrition et Go�t;Nutrition and Taste;;
Ibarlucea-Jerez;Maria;Influence of fermented food consumption on oral microbiota and taste perception;Oral;Oral microbiota varies throughout the individual?s life. These changes could be due to the impact of several factors (environmental, physiological...) that shape the diversity and composition of the oral microbiota. Among these factors, the diet and particularly a short-term consumption of dairy fermented food, has been shown to influence oral microbiota through a temporary oral colonization. However, little is known about the physiological impact of this temporary colonization. Taste perception is one of the potentially affected functions. Indeed, our team has recently shown a link between oral microbiota and taste perception in humans. In this context, this project has two main goals: to study the impact of exogenous microbiota from fermented food (cheese) on host oral microbiota, and to evaluate the role of this food microbiota in the modulation of taste perception.For this purpose, two groups of rats (n=27/group) were fed experimental cheeses with or without live bacteria for 3 weeks. Rat saliva was collected at different times for bacterial composition analysis (qPCR and 16S rRNA sequencing). Taste sensitivity was evaluated using a two-bottle test and four sucrose solutions with decreasing concentration.As first results, we showed that one third of the rats who have eaten cheese containing live bacteria had those bacteria in their saliva transiently. No significant effect was observed on taste sensitivity. This work shows that fermented food can modulate temporarily the composition of rat oral microbiota.;2;9h54;10h09;Session 1;Nutrition et Go�t;Nutrition and Taste;;
Nivet;Clement;Development of a new in vitro model of oral mucosa to investigate a new hypothesis on the molecular origin of astringency;Oral;Astringency is described as an oral tactile perception occurring during the consumption of tannin-rich foods. This sensation, mediated by the trigeminal nerves, participates negatively to the flavor of foods leading to the rejection of food with high astringency by the consumer. The exact molecular mechanism of its origin and the nature of the sensory receptors activated are still under debate. Up to recently, the main hypotheses involves changes in the lubrication properties of the oral cavity triggering the activation of mechanoreceptors. Recently, we have put a new hypothesis involving the mucin MUC1 forward as an explanation of the origin of astringency. MUC1 is a transmembrane mucin with two subunits linked by noncovalent interactions. It is expressed at the surface of oral epithelial cells impacting on the surface lubrication and the anchoring of the salivary proteins composing the mucosal pellicle (MP). MUC1 is also described as a sensor of the external cellular medium. Thus, we have proposed that MUC1 aggregation by astringent compounds disrupts its two subunits, inducing two different and sequential mechanisms: an intracellular signalling pathway leading to the release of neurotransmitter activating trigeminal free ending nerves and a disruption of the MP increasing the friction forces at the surface of the mucosa. To investigate this hypothesis, we have developed an innovating in vitro model of oral mucosa based on the transfection of the TR146 oral epithelial cell line with genes coding for different isoforms of MUC1, which differ by the length of the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) module and the cleavage of proprotein at the origin of the 2 subunits. Stable expression clones have been selected and their ability to anchor salivary proteins and form the mucosal pellicle has been compared to the one of a previous TR146 cell line transfected with a non-cleavable isoform of MUC1 that do not have a VNTR module.;2;10h12;10h27;Session 1;Nutrition et Go�t;Nutrition and Taste;;
Phimnuan;Preeyawass;Determination of the Gamma-irradiated blended fibroin/aloe gel extract wound dressing on physicochemical and biological properties related to wound healing;Oral;In this study, the physicochemical and biological properties of the blended fibroin/aloe gel extract wound dressing, sterilized by gamma irradiation, were determined to support its wound healing efficacy. Our previous studies found that the prepared film exerts potential healing effects, including experimentations in vitro, in vivo in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and clinical trials in diabetic foot ulcer patients. Protein content, molecular weight pattern, and chemical characteristics were separately determined in the silk fibroin and the aloe gel extracts. Then, both extracts were dissolved in lactic acid solution and cast to obtain the blended fibroin/aloe gel extract wound dressing. Subsequently, the physicochemical and biological properties of the prepared film were determined. Our study found that gamma irradiation does not affect any physicochemical properties of the prepared film, including physical appearance (flexible, translucent, and yellowish film), surface morphology (non-porous morphology), mechanical properties (breaking force of non-sterilized film: 6.038�0.746 N and broke: 1.147�0.119%, similar to the sterilized film: 6.26�0.44 N and 1.20�0.07%), and chemical characteristic information (presenting of amide I, II, III, glucan units, pyranoside ring, and mannose). The proliferation of the film-treated cells was higher than the untreated cells, as indicated by cell cycle analysis, with a shift from G0/G1 phase (76.26�0.72%) to S phase (7.19�0.23%) and G2/M phase (16.09�0.58%) for the film-treated cells as compared to untreated cells, 92.47�2.44, 2.53�0.92 and 4.67�1.61%, respectively. For cell migration, the film-treated cells provided a completely healed wound at 36h after scratch creation, while untreated cells were not healed at the same time. According to biological activity, the prepared film can enhance the proliferation and migration of the fibroblast cells and stimulate the wound healing process in diabetic foot ulcers.;2;9h;9h15;Session 1;Divers 2;Miscellaneous 2;;
Baverel;Valentin;The heat shock protein glucose-related protein 94 interacts with the proprotein convertase furin and modulates its enzymatic activity;Oral;Background: Furin is a proprotein convertase involved in the activation of precursor proteins, including oncogenic proteins and viral envelope glycoproteins. Glucose-related protein 94 (GRP94) is an endoplasmic reticulum stress protein that has been shown by our team to interact with cathepsin L, another protease involved in a wide range of cellular functions.Objectives: The objectives of this work were to study whether GRP94 interacts with furin and if so, whether it modulates its enzymatic activity.Methods: The GRP94-furin interaction was investigated using microscale thermophoresis and intracellularly, in 4T1 cells (triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells) and in human M2 primary macrophages, using proximity ligation assay (PLA). Furin enzymatic activity was measured in both cell types, treated or not with the GRP94 inhibitor PU-WS13.Results: The microscale thermophoresis results showed that GRP94 interacts with furin. Interaction was confirmed intracellularly by PLA in 4T1 cells and in M2 macrophages. PU-WS13 induced a significant decrease in furin enzymatic activity in both cell types, showing the role of GRP94 in modulating furin activity.Conclusion: GRP94 interacts with furin in 4T1 TNBC cells as well as in human M2 macrophages and modulates its enzymatic activity. The consequences on activation of the different furin substrates that are TGF-?1, MT1-MMP, IGF-1R as well as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are being investigated to better understand the role of this interaction in TNBC and SARS-CoV-2 infection.;2;9h18;9h33;Session 1;Divers 2;Miscellaneous 2;;
Vasku;Glenda;Matrix-assisted laser desorption imaging profiling of human retina reveals a distinct lipidomic pattern;Oral;Retina is a thin layer of tissue that covers the innermost back of the eye and is responsible for central and color vision. It represents a morphologically and functionally distinct system, which is able to perform a complex visual output. Visual transduction is a process that initiates in the retina and is translated into the occipital lobe of the brain, through specialized cells. Indeed, retina is part of the nervous system, which is considered to be the second highest organ rich in lipids, after adipose tissue. Lipids have important roles in energy storage, cell structure and signaling. Typically, in the retina lipids are crucial for the overall well-functioning of neural cells. Moreover, they are positive contributors in the visual transduction circuit. Multifactorial causes, such as genetic, environmental and aging factors can disrupt the lipid metabolism in the retina, resulting in lipid degradation. Such condition interferes with the normal visual process and can potentially initiate retinal based pathologies such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).Our purpose in this work was to analyze the overall human retinal lipidome and to reveal specific localized lipids within the human retina tissue, through Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-IMS). For that purpose, human eye?s retina was fixed and analyzed after matrix deposition through sublimation. Data was acquired in full scan using a Bruker RapiFlex MALDI-IMS instrument. Five classes of lipid species were analyzed in positive mode (PC, LysoPC, PE, LysoPE, SM, Cer, TG, DG, PS and CE), which were found to be distributed differently across the whole retina?s section. Such distinct lipid pattern could increase our understanding of lipids role in diseases such as AMD, where retinal lipid extracellular deposits are formed.;2;9h36;9h51;Session 1;Divers 2;Miscellaneous 2;;
Daniel;Alexandrine;Validation of graph-based connectivity models using genetic data;Oral;Modelling the functional connectivity of habitats is crucial for biodiversity conservation. Landscape graphs, by modelling habitat patches linked by potential dispersal paths, are often used to quantify landscape connectivity. While this approach seems promising, it often lacks biological validation. To ensure its ecological relevance, we assessed the ability of connectivity metrics from landscape graphs to predict population genetic structure that closely reflects the dispersal of individuals, and thus functional connectivity. We modelled the habitat network of a forest bird species (Plumbeous warbler, Setophaga plumbea) in Guadeloupe using three graphs, constructed either from expert opinion, specialization indices, or a species distribution model (SDM). Genetic data (microsatellites) were also collected on 712 individuals in 27 populations. This genetic dataset was used as an empirical validation tool for the three landscape graphs, using two approaches: i) relating the cost-distances from the graphs to the genetic distances between populations, ii) relating the connectivity metrics from the graphs to the genetic diversity indices within the populations. The large proportion of variance in genetic distances explained by least-cost paths and the strong correlations between connectivity metrics and genetic indices demonstrate the ability of landscape graphs to model the influence of landscape connectivity on dispersal. In addition, our results provide insight into the relationships between construction costs and ecological relevance of landscape graphs, as the most complex approach (SDM) is not always the most efficient.;2;9h54;10h09;Session 1;Divers 2;Miscellaneous 2;;
Fouilloux;Pierre;In-situ differentiation and quantification of crosslinked Iron(II) and Iron(III) in polysaccharide hydrogel by 1H-low field NMR Relaxometry;Oral;Iron is one of the most important micronutrients for humans and animals. Although abundant in the environment most of it is present in oxidised form (Iron(III)) which is less compatible with animal physiology. Supplementing iron(II), the most bioavailable form of iron, is a critical point to fight against anaemia or iron deficiency. However, most of the existing analytical methods used to quantify iron in food and biological matrices cannot differentiate between iron(II) and iron(III). Moreover, such methods require the destruction of the sample. We propose an innovative methods based on 1H-low field NMR, which can differentiate and quantify Fe(II) and Fe(III) inside a polygalacturonate-based hydrogel formed by these two cations. Polygalacturonate (polyGalA) is composed by the association of galacturonic units which are the main component of the pectin. Previous work showed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) that iron(II) in Fe(II)-polyGalA hydrogel keeps its oxidation degree (II). Moreover, a gradient of iron concentration, determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), was observed inside the gel. NMR relaxometry method is based on the difference in the relaxation of protons in interaction with paramagnetic species such as iron(II) and iron(III). T1 distributions can be transformed in iron concentrations and expected gradient of concentrations is found in good agreement with AAS.;2;10h12;10h27;Session 1;Divers 2;Miscellaneous 2;;
Mathey;Aline;Essential oils, Pituranthos chloranthus and Teucrium ramosissimum, chemosensitize resistant human uterine sarcoma cells to doxorubicin by inducing apoptosis and targeting P-glycoprotein;Oral;The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype defined, among others, by insensitivity to cell death signals and the overexpression of active drug efflux transporters, is well-recognized as a major obstacle to efficient chemotherapeutic treatment in various cancers such as uterine sarcomas, characterized by a short survival and poor prognosis. Over the last decades, a growing research interest has been focused on the development of new chemopreventive and chemosensitizing strategies aimed at overcoming chemoresistance, reducing toxicity, side effects and potentiating cytotoxic drug efficacy. Among the new types of anticancer agents responding to these promising approaches, the plant kingdom, with beneficial effects on health, has become a focus of particular attention. Hence, we sought to determine the therapeutic potential of two essential oils from Tunisia, Pituranthos chloranthus (PC) and Teucrium ramosissimum Desf. (TR), to restore the sensitivity of multidrug-resistant uterine sarcoma cells to doxorubicin, a commonly used anticancer agent in sarcoma treatment. We first show that PC and TR were able to inhibit cell viability of the sensitive MES-SA and the doxorubicin-resistant variant MES-SA/Dx5 cell line. Mechanistically, PC and TR trigger caspase-mediated apoptosis, an overproduction of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane depolarization in both sensitive and resistant uterine sarcoma cells. Very interestingly, we demonstrate that PC and TR synergize with doxorubicin, leading to an increased cell death in resistant cells. These drug combination studies also show that the dose of doxorubicin can be reduced, thus limiting toxicity in anticancer therapy while maintaining drug efficiency. Finally, these synergistic effects were reinforced by a decrease in P-glycoprotein expression and activity, which subsequently lead to intracellular doxorubicin accumulation in resistant sarcoma cells. Altogether, our findings strengthen the significance of bioactive compounds to counteract the MDR phenotype and restore the sensitivity of aggressive cancers to conventional chemotherapies.;2;15h40;15h55;Session 2;Canc�rologie 3;Oncology 3;;
Geindreau;Mannon;Role of immune cells in the anti-tumor response following an anti-PD-1 and anti-VEGFR-2 combination therapy;Oral;Cancer, being the second leading cause of death worldwide, is a major public health problem. In order to improve the therapeutic arsenal against cancer, research projects aim to determine new treatments or therapeutic combinations.In the last ten years, immunotherapy has emerged as a new therapeutic option and aims at restoring an efficient anti-tumor immune response against tumor cells. Various immunotherapies exist and some of them target immune checkpoint. Checkpoint inhibitors prevent T cells exhaustion that is induced by the tumor microenvironment. However, 80 % patients are non-responders to this treatment with one of the reasons potentially being a poor T cell infiltration into tumors. To increase the efficiency of this immunotherapy, targeting another mechanism such as angiogenesis could be interesting.Angiogenesis is a key mechanism in the tumor development, it corresponds to the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing blood vessels. This mechanism is induced by hypoxia and allows a proper nutrients and oxygen supply to the growing tumor. In cancer, this mechanism induces the formation of abnormal blood vessels that disrupt immune cells and drug diffusion into the tumor. It also suppresses the anti-tumor immune response by inducing an immunosuppressive microenvironment.As a matter of fact, this therapeutic combination has been the subject of clinical studies in multiple solid cancers and is approved by the FDA for the treatment of different solid cancers. However, the consequences of this combination of treatments on the immune system are still poorly known. In this context, I try to understand the role of the immune system following an anti-angiogenic and checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy. Depletion of these populations confirmed their crucial role in the efficacy of the combination therapy and we are now deciphering the cascade of events leading to this phenomenon.;2;15h58;16h13;Session 2;Canc�rologie 3;Oncology 3;;
Fredon;Maxime;High-throughput preclinical screening of CD123 single chain fragment variable to design 3rd generation of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell in the treatment of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm patient;Oral;"Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN) is an aggressive haemopathy characterised by consistent overexpression of the CD123 antigen on 100% of blasts identifying CD123 as a target antigen for the development of targeted therapies. We have developed a CD123 CAR-T immunotherapy to redirect T lymphocytes expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Although CAR-T therapy is well described in the literature, its design is a complex process requiring optimizations to ensure (i) strong and stable expression of the CAR on the surface of the T lymphocyte and (ii) efficient and specific recognition of the target antigen. These optimizations are crucial to maintain therapeutic effects in the long term and to avoid side effects related to the ""on-target, off-tumor"" effect.In this study, we produced five third generation CD123 CAR-T composed of different single chain Fragment variables (scFv). The aim of the project was to evaluate which of these five CD123 CAR-T had the best cytotoxicity differential between leukemic cells and healthy cells that could weakly express the target antigen.We therefore assessed the transduction efficiency and the expression of CAR at the T cell membrane by flow cytometry. Subsequently, we assessed the capacity for degranulation, secretion of effector cytokines and lysis after co-culture with target cells. We then assessed the clonogenic capacity of hematopoietic stem cells after contact with CAR-T as well as the cell lysis of endothelial cells and monocytes after contact with CD123 CAR-T. Finally, we evaluated the functionality of CD123 CAR-Ts in vivo in three immunodeficiency mouse models and showed that treatment with CD123 CAR-T significantly increased the overall survival of mice by reducing tumor uptake.We show that the choice of scFv in a CAR-T approach is essential to ensure good anti-cancer functionality while ensuring the safety of healthy cells.";2;16h16;16h31;Session 2;Canc�rologie 3;Oncology 3;;
Assogba;Emerline;What are young women living conditions after breast cancer? Health-related quality of life, sexual and fertility issues, professional reinsertion;Oral;"Introduction: Over the last decades, living conditions of young breast cancer (BC) survivors have received special attention. This population-based study aimed to identify clinical, social and economic determinants of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and describe other living conditions of young long-term BC survivors.Methods: Non-metastatic BC women diagnosed between 2006 and 2015, aged 45 years and younger at diagnosis were identified through the French C�te d?Or Breast and Gynecologic Cancer Registry. Participants completed self-report questionnaires including standardized measures (HRQoL, anxiety, depression, deprivation, social support and sexuality); fertility and professional reintegration issues. The determinants of HRQoL were identified using mixed regression model.Results: In total, 218 BC survivors participated in the survey. The main determinants of poor HRQoL were anxiety, depression, comorbidities, deprivation and menopausal status. Among 72% of women who did not receive information about fertility preservation 38% would have liked to be informed. Finally, 39% of survivors reported a negative impact of BC on their professional activity and in 59% this negative impact still persisted at the time of the survey.Conclusions: This study showed that BC stage or treatments did not have an impact on young long-term BC survivors HRQOL. Fertility, sexuality and professional reintegration, remained the main issues for survivors. Specific interventions in this population should focus on these issues.";2;16h34;16h49;Session 2;Canc�rologie 3;Oncology 3;;
Kroudia Wasse;Stephane;The impact of psychosocial and clinical factors on quality of life after non-Hodgkin's lymphoma;Oral;Aims: To identify the clinical and social determinants of long-term health related quality of life (HRQoL) in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) survivors in the general population.Methods: All patients were registered in the population-based cancer registry specialized in hematological malignancies in the C�te d?Or area. We identified patients diagnosed with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) according to the third edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3), from January 1st 2010 to December, 31st 2017, and who were still alive on March, 1st 2021, with an updated address. Patients under 18 years old and adults unable to provide consent were not eligible. In March 2021, patients completed standardized self-report questionnaires for HRQoL (SF-12), reminders were sent to non-responders after one month. The determinants of HRQoL were identified using a generalized linear model.Results: Among 436 patients diagnosed, 248 were alive at the study endpoint, of whom 157 (FL 51% and DLBCL 49%) completed the questionnaires, yielding a response rate of 63.3%, the median of time since diagnosis was 76 months [39-133]. The mean age of participants was 67.3 years (SD = 12.4), 55% were men, 74% Ann Arbor stage III-IV, 78% were treated by chemotherapy and immunotherapy, 64% did not have comorbidities, 27% were employed at the time of the survey, 60% of survivors had not received information about sexuality, 54% reported an impact of the COVID crisis on their life. The main factors associated with a negative impact on HRQoL were depression, anxiety, and loss of sexual desire.Conclusions: Six years after diagnosis, clinical parameters did not have a major influence on HRQoL. The main determinants of HRQoL identified were psychological and social factors. All these elements are potential targets for specific interventions by the social system to improve HRQoL in NHL patients.;2;16h52;17h07;Session 2;Canc�rologie 3;Oncology 3;;
Chaney;Remi;Effect of acute neuromuscular electrical stimulation on cognition and mood in healthy humans;Oral;Physical exercise is recognized as one of the most effective non-drug strategies for improving mental health. For example, studies show a preventive effect on neurodegenerative diseases and stroke, improved cognition and mood through exercise. Nevertheless, many people are unable to perform exercise for various reasons. For these people, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) which consists on induced muscle contraction without motor command in response to an external current source could be an alternative to exercise. Indeed, NMES allows mimicking the effects of exercise on muscle function but its effect on cognition and mood remains unstudied to this day. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a single session of NMES on executive function, memory and mood in humans.For this purpose, young healthy volunteers (n=30, 24 years old) performed an NMES session on the quadriceps muscle (100 Hz, 0.2 ms) with an alternation of 7s of contraction and 14s of rest for 30 min at maximum tolerable intensity. Other subjects remained 30 min passive on a chair as control subjects. Executive function and mood were assessed using the Stroop task and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire before and immediately after the NMES session, respectively. Memory was assessed with the complex Rey figure and a 15word list recall immediately and 24 hours after the NMES session. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) were recorded every 5 min during NMES.Results show improved performance on the Stroop task and reduced anxiety after NMES session. In contrast, we did not observe any effect on memory, HR, BP and SaO2. In conclusion, NMES can be an interesting option to improve executive function and mood without intensive cardiac solicitation.;2;15h40;15h55;Session 2;Cognition et Mouvement;Cognition and Mouvement;;
Eon;Pauline;Intensity effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation combined with motor imagery on corticospinal excitability;Oral;IntroductionNeuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) consists of evoking muscle contraction by an external electrical current without voluntary activation. On the contrary, motor imagery (MI) is the mental simulation of contraction without its corresponding motor output. Some studies analyzed the impact of MI and NMES on corticospinal excitability highlighted by the motor evoked potential (MEP). The authors reported that MI and NMES performed alone increased the MEP compared to rest (1, 2). However, the intensity of NMES may alter the corticospinal excitability when NMES is applied above the motor threshold compared to MI alone (1). Therefore, these results question the impact of the intensity of NMES on corticospinal excitability when combined with MI. The purpose of the present study is to assess corticospinal excitability during either MI, NMES, or a combination of both at different stimulation intensities of NMES.MethodsSeven healthy subjects participated in one session consisting of 6 conditions targeting flexor carpi radialis muscle (FCR): rest, MI, NMES evoked at 5 % and 20 % maximal voluntary contraction and MI and NMES performed simultaneously (MI+NMES) with both NMES intensities. During each condition, corticospinal excitability was assessed by evoking MEP of FCR by using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Maximal M-wave (Mmax) was measured by using nerve stimulation of the median nerve.ResultsA repeated measures ANOVA revealed a main effect among conditions (P = 0.01). We found a significant difference on MEP/Mmax at rest compared to NMES and MI+NMES at 20 % MVC. Furthermore, a two-way ANOVA revealed an intensity effect. The post hoc analysis showed a higher MEP/Mmax during NMES and MI+NMES at both 20 % compared to 5 % MVC.DiscussionThe additional effect of MI on MEP/Mmax may occur with NMES at 20 % rather than 5%. This suggests that a sufficient muscle activation is required to improve the cortical command from MI and enhance the activation of both cortical and subcortical structures. Therefore, MI+NMES could result in improvement of the corticospinal excitability of FCR.;2;15h58;16h13;Session 2;Cognition et Mouvement;Cognition and Mouvement;;
Godin;Antoine;Impact of speed and slope on stride variability;Oral;"INTRODUCTION:Evaluation of variability in running stride is increasing as evidence have linked stride variability with fatigue, injury, or overreaching. Several parameters can be used like stride time (Ts), contact time (Tc), flight time (Tf) or cadence (C). Their variability can be described through different indexes: amount of variation (AV), predictability and complexity. However, impact of measurement conditions such as slope and running speed are currently unknown and the aim of this study is to investigate their effect on stride variability.METHODS:20 runners performed a treadmill test with 5 conditions derived from preferred running speed (PRS; 100 +/- 10/20%) and 6 slopes (+/- 8%, 5%, 2%,). Ts, Tc, Tf and C were measured with an Optogait�. AV was quantified by coefficient of variation (CV). Predictability was evaluated using alpha-1 coefficient of detrended fluctuation analysis (aDFA) and complexity by Higuchi fractal index (HFI). Two one-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis were performed to assess effect of slope and speed independently.RESULTS:At negative slopes AV was higher than at flat or positive slopes (p<0.05) for Ts (-8%: 3.12%�1.52; 0%: 2.20%�0.41 8%:2.44%�0.41), Tc, Tv and C.As speed increased, AV for Tv decreased (80%: 23.16%�7.04; 120%: 9.18%�2.81; p<0.05). AV for Tc was higher at 80% than other conditions (80%: 2.72%�0.93; 120%: 2.34%�0.62; p<0.05).As regards aDFA, higher values at positive slopes and flat compared with negative slopes were observed for Ts (-8%: 0.59�0.14; 0%: 0.65�0.09; 8%:0.67�0.18; p<0.05).For HFI, lower value at 80% than other conditions were observed for C (80%: 0.93�0.29;120%: 1.16�0.9; p<0.05).CONCLUSION:Runners show a greater AV at low speeds or at negative slopes. They are also less predictable and complex on some kinematics at these conditions. Future studies are needed to link these results to running economy or the occurrence of overuse injuries.";2;16h16;16h31;Session 2;Cognition et Mouvement;Cognition and Mouvement;;
Dury;Jeanne;Hip abductor muscle fatigue induces different strategies during disrupted postural control;Oral;"Background: Ankle sprain is one of the most common injuries in sport, and hip abductor muscle weakness has recently been reported as a predisposing factor.However, the influence of hip abductor muscle fatigue on ankle stability has not been studied during an ankle disturbed balance exercise. This study aimed to determine the influence of hip abductor muscle fatigue on ankle joint stability during a disturbed balance task, and to consider inter-individual variability in the kinematic and neuromuscular reorganizations implemented.Methods: Twenty-six healthy subjects (13 males; 13 females) performed a unipedal postural balance task (BAL) with eyes closed before and after a fatiguing exercise (up to a 50% decrease in strength) of the hip abductor muscles. Subjects completed BAL while equipped with an ankle destabilization device that allows inversion/eversion movements. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of the gastrocnemius lateralis (GastL), peroneus longus (PL) ,brevis, tibialis anterior and gluteus medius were recorded during BAL. Kinematics (e.g., frontal foot angulation, FAng) of the ankle complex were determined using inertial measurement units.Results and significance: In the overall group, no significant time, sex or interaction effect was observed on kinematic and EMG variables. However, when considering individual responses to hip fatigue, 14 subjects decreased the standard deviation of FAng (-30%) suggesting enhancement of ankle stability, while 12 subjects increased the standard deviation of the FAng (+46%). Normalized EMG variations for PL and GastL muscles were significantly different between groups (p=0.027 for PL and p=0.006 for GastL). Indeed, the contribution of ankle muscles increased for the enhanced-stability group while decreased for the impaired-stability group. These results highlight that subject adopt different neuromuscular and kinematic ankle strategies to control balance in response to hip abductor muscle fatigue. The strategy adopted by the impaired-stability group might have important implications when analyzing risk factors for ankle sprains.";2;16h31;16h46;Session 2;Cognition et Mouvement;Cognition and Mouvement;;
Amiez;Nicolas;Corticospinal modulations of wrist tendon vibration are time-dependent;Oral;Aims: The application of tendon vibration (TV) causes movement illusions through Ia afferents. The responses of the vibrated (agonist) and non-vibrated (antagonist) muscles to the integration of this sensory information were studied at the corticospinal and spinal levels.Methods: TV was applied to the FCR muscle (Duration: 30', Format: continuous, Frequency: 80hz, Amplitude: 0.5mm). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs, 17 subjects), Cervico-medullary-evoked potentials (CMEPs, 15 subjects), and Hoffmannreflexes (H, 15 subjects) of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) were measured in three different sessions. Four blocks of measurement were performed for each session: before TV (PRE) and at 0' (P0), 30' (P30) and 60' (P60) after vibrations were stopped. All measurements were performed at rest. Ratios MEP/CMEP for FCR and ECR muscle (15 subjects) and ratio H/CMEP for the FCR muscle (13 subjects) were also measured.Results: MEPs remained unchanged (p > 0,073) while CMEPs decreased at P0 (p < 0,001) for both muscles. The H-reflex of the FCR largely decreased at P0 and P30 (p < 0,001). The MEP/CMEP ratio increased for both muscles at P0 (p < 0,05). The H/CMEP ratio decreased at P0 (p = 0,065) and P30 for the FCR muscle (p < 0,001).Conclusions: A temporary increase in cortical excitability (ratios MEP/CMEP) occurs for both the vibrated (FCR) and nonvibrated (ECR) muscles while a decrease in motor neuron excitability (CMEP) is observed at the same time for the two muscles. The decrease in spinal excitability (CMEP) alone does not explain the decrease in H-reflex observed for the FCR muscle at P0 and P30. Thus, a presynaptic cause could also be involved in the decrease of this reflex.;2;16h49;17h04;Session 2;Cognition et Mouvement;Cognition and Mouvement;;
Pellerin;Alice;Extreme carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures preserved in 2.7 billion years old sedimentary rocks: evidence for the onset of planetary oxygenation? New insight from the Caraj�s basin, Brazil;Oral;Nitrogen is a key element of the biosphere, present in numerous macromolecules and involved in major metabolic pathways. As the nitrogen isotopic composition of sedimentary rocks is controlled by redox speciation in the water column together with biological activity, changes in the dominating nitrogen biogeochemical cycle?s pathways have frequently been used to uncover the joint evolution of the atmosphere, the ocean and the biosphere. In particular, nitrogen isotopes can specify the timing and mechanisms of the transition from anoxic to oxygenated environments leading to the ?2.4 Ga Great Oxidation Event (GOE), which remains debated.This study features new data from the Caraj�s basin, Amazonian Craton, Brazil. Samples from three drill cores through the Serra Sul and Azul formations, aged between 2.72 and 2.68 Ga and representative of shallow to deep oceanic settings, have been analyzed for their carbon and nitrogen abundances and isotopic compositions. These sediments display extremely positive ?15N values of up to +35.1? combined with extremely negative ?13Corg values down to -51.7?, similar to those observed in the 2.72 Ga Tumbiana formation in Australia. The drivers of this unique isotopic excursion occurring ?300 million years before the GOE are controversial, and two hypotheses have been put forward: (i) the onset of an aerobic nitrogen cycling, with partial oxidation of ammonium through nitrification followed by complete denitrification and (ii) ammonia volatilization in anoxic, highly alkaline conditions typical of restricted lacustrine environments.The Caraj�s basin uncovers a new occurrence of the 2.7 Ga extreme 15N-enrichments and 13C-depletions event from oceanic settings. Therefore, it sheds new light on a previously isolated signal related to a restricted alkaline environment. Whether this event stands as evidence for widespread redox changes in marine chemistry or rather reflects local settings remains to be discussed, but in any case it points towards specific environmental conditions.;2;15h40;15h55;Session 2;G�ologie;Geology;;
Abi Nader;Anthony;Underground karst river monitoring using seismic noise;Oral;Unlike surface water containers, that can be easily quantified and monitored, underground pipeline in karst systems are often inaccessible and therefore challenging to monitor. Our knowledge of inaccessible karst aquifers is therefore mostly based on punctual measurements. This study is a part of the SISMEAUCLIM project which aims to image the flow of water in 3 dimensions over time from rainfall to the outlet in the Fourbanne karst aquifer (Jura Mountains, Eastern France, Jurassic Karst observatory).Our approach relies on passive ambient noise methods that will be coupled with hydrological parameters in order to monitor underground water flows. The underground conduit is accessible through a drilled shaft and instrumented by two 3-component seismological stations and a water-level probe. We performed a joint analysis between the seismic noise spectrograms and the underground river water level in order to quantify the increase in noise intensity as a function of water level and characterize the noise source. As a second step, we applied a new approach based on the machine learning random forest (RF) algorithm and continuous seismic records, to predict the underground river water height. The method consists on the computation on a sliding window of seismic signal features (waveform, spectral and spectrogram features) and calibrating them with the corresponding water height.Furthermore, with data provided from a dense seismic array, noise cross-correlation analysis will be carried out to detect seismic velocity variations in the medium induced by fluid saturation changes.;2;15h58;16h13;Session 2;G�ologie;Geology;;
Lecacheur;Kilian;Ductile - brittle transition in the subducting oceanic lithosphere. A structural analysis of Alpine ophiolites associated with mechanical studies of deformation;Oral;The largest earthquakes recorded on earth (Mw 9+) occurred in subduction zones which are characterized by the sliding of a tectonic plate under another. The location of seismicity in subduction zones is divided in three seismic zones following their hypocentral depths: 1) the shallow seismic zone down to 70 km where 90% of the total seismic energy is released, 2) the Intermediate Depth Seismicity (IDS) between 70 and 300 km and 3) the deep seismic zone between 300 and 700 km. Here, the PhD is focused on the understanding of intermediate depth earthquakes where the triggering mechanism remains poorly understood compared to shallow earthquakes.Indeed, the high pressure and temperature at the IDS is supposed to suppress frictional failure. One explanation for that is the release of free-water during the breakdown of hydrous minerals in the subducted oceanic crust (e.g., antigorite, chlorite, lawsonite) at high pressure and temperature. This free water can then be pressurized if the permeability of the surrounding rock is low enough, allowing a transition from viscous deformation (i.e. aseismic) to brittle deformation (i.e. seismic). The origin of IDS could thus be related to fluid-flow following these mechanisms: (I) hydraulic fracturing, (II) dehydration embrittlement, (III) mineral transformation induced faulting (Hacker et al., 2003b, Fumagalli and Poli, 2005, and Poli and Schmidt, 2002, Angiboust et al. 2012, 2014, Magott et al., 2016, 2017, Locatelli et al., 2018). However, the development and maintenance of fluid-flow at such high depths is still unknown.The aim of this PhD is thus to understand the effects of fluid migration on the triggering of intermediate depth earthquakes by combining 1) Structural and petrological analyses from non-deformed to highly deformed rocks coming from the Alpine subducted Ophiolite (Valle d'Aosta) and 2) Laboratory experiments of rock mechanics (i.e. porosity and permeability) across deformation gradients to characterize the effects of deformation and mineral transformation on fluid-flow.;2;16h16;16h31;Session 2;G�ologie;Geology;;
Klaba;Victor;Hydrogeological modelling of the Arcier karstic hydrosystem ?

Its vulnerability, due to a complex structure, combined with the diversity of anthropogenic pressures and the issue of climate change strongly impact the water quality. So, their study is crucial to answer these societal, economic, and ecological challenges, both at large and small scales.
The TRANSKARST (TRANSdisciplinary research on KARST) research consortium, gathering scientists and water resource managers, is dedicated to the study of the Arcier karstic spring (Eastern France). An holistic approach based on multidisciplinary studies is carried out to the Arcier’s catchment aiming at improving our understanding of the origin, the pathways and the impact of mineral, organic and microbiological contaminations affecting regional karstic aquifers.
The first step allows to have a comprehensive view of the geological structure and the hydrodynamical behavior of the Arcier hydrosystem. Since February 2020, a rigorous field work have been done to collect numerous data: structural geology, geophysics (ERT, gravimetry and passive seismics), hydrodynamics (rainfall, water level/flow rate), physico- chemical (electrical conductivity, temperature, turbidity, major and traces ions, isotopes) data and artificial tracer tests.
Detailed studies of the geological structure and the fracturation network were compiled in a 3D numerical model (Geomodeller 3D). The first results show a new vision of the local geology : the watershed is delimited by complex fold and thrust structures, located on both sides of a tabular plateau. An intensive fracturation, linked to its tectonic story and the karstification, is observable. This first conclusions combined with hydrodynamic data, throughout a rainfall/flow rate analysis, and tracer tests, show a direct link between the geology and the karst reactivity. Then the Geomodeller 3D model will be input in a 3D hydrogeological model (Visual Karsys) to confirm the first conclusions.

Havas;Robin;Active but hidden role of DOC in the C cycle of Precambrian analogs stratified lakes: an isotopic study;Oral;"The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoir holds a critical role in past and modern Earth?s surficial biogeochemical cycles, both because of its size (e.g. oceanic DOC equals the amount of atmospheric CO2) and its involvement in many biogeochemical reactions. Isotopic analyses are powerful tracers of such phenomena, either at a global or local microbial scale, and have been widely used in laboratory and natural environments studies for most carbon-containing phases. However, DOC isotopic data remain scarce in the literature.Here, we measured DOC concentration and isotopic composition through the water columns of four Mexican volcanic stratified crater lakes, exhibiting diverse planktonic communities and deprived of allochthonous DOC sources. In parallel, we analyzed dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) reservoirs in order to constrain the specific role of DOC within the carbon cycle (production, recycling, accumulation) of these environments.The four lakes have high DOC concentrations (representing approximately 70 times the amount of POC, averaging 2 � 4 mM; 1SD, n=28) with important variability between and within the lakes. All lakes exhibit peaks of DOC (up to 21 mM) found in the oxic or anoxic zones, or both. ?13CDOC also covers a broad range of values from -29.3 to -8.7 ? (with as much as 12.5 ? variation within a single lake).DOC peaks in depth profiles and associated isotopic variability seem related to oxygenic and/or anoxygenic primary productivity through the release of excess fixed carbon in three of the lakes, while in the last one they could be explained by partial degradation and accumulation in anoxic waters. Our results show that DOC records metabolic reactions that would not have been detected if only DIC and POC reservoirs were analyzed. Thus, they highlight how DOC characterization offers a more complete view of these environments? carbon cycle and biogeochemical functioning.";2;16h49;17h04;Session 2;G�ologie;Geology;;
